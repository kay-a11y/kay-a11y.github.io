Welcome to a series of human-scale stories about the early years of cryptocurrency, blockchain rebellion, and the strange, often chaotic path that got us here.

Not written for traders. Not a guide to moonshots.  
Just timeless moments, frozen in digital code.

## ✍️ About the Project

It's part history, part observation - and part archival poetry for future hackers, learners, and wanderers.

I also write technical guides for Python, JS, config tweaks, and minimal digital life.  
Sometimes dark mode rants included.

Feel free to explore.  
Or just bookmark this page and come back when the chain grows longer.
