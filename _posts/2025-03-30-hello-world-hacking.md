## Welcome to My Digital Playground!

This is my first post on my new GitHub Pages blog, powered by Jekyll.

Here, I plan to document my adventures (and misadventures) in the world of code, security, privacy, and maybe some V for Vendetta style musings.

```python
print("Chaos is the new black.")
```
Stay tuned... or don't. The choice, like the vulnerability, is yours to discover.
