## 🌟 **Compression Software - How It Works**

Compression software **removes or reduces unnecessary data** while keeping the important parts so that the **image still looks nice and clear**. But it's a little more sophisticated than just deleting "extra dots."

### 🔥 **There are two main types of compression:**

1. **Lossless Compression**
2. **Lossy Compression**

### 1. 🔒 **Lossless Compression (No Data Lost)**

- This method **compresses the image without losing any quality or detail**.
- It works by finding **patterns and redundancies** within the data and storing them more efficiently.
- **Example:** ZIP, PNG (Portable Network Graphics)
- 📸 When you open the compressed file, you get back the exact same image as the original. No quality loss, just a smaller file size.

**Example of how it works:**  
Imagine you have an image with a big blue sky. Instead of storing `blue, blue, blue, blue...` for each pixel, the software can just say `1000x blue`. It's like shorthand!

### 2. ✂️ **Lossy Compression (Some Data Lost, But Looks Good)**

- This is the type where the picture **still looks good but the file size is way smaller**.
- It **removes bits of data that are considered less important**-like tiny color details or parts the human eye wouldn't notice much.
- **Example:** JPEG, MP3, MP4 (yeah, it applies to music and videos too!)
- 📸 When you open the compressed file, you don't get the exact original. But if done well, your eyes won't even notice the difference.

**How it works:**

- It **analyzes the image** and decides what parts are most important.
- It might **smooth out areas that are all the same color**, or **merge tiny variations in shades** that aren't noticeable.
- It may **simplify complex textures or shapes** that are too detailed for your eye to catch anyway.

### 🌈 **Why Pictures Still Look Good After Compression:**

- **Human Vision Limitations:** Your eyes can't see super fine details or subtle color changes, so compression algorithms take advantage of that.
- **Smart Algorithms:** Things like **JPEG compression** use techniques like **Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT)** to split an image into parts and simplify it without making it look bad.
- **Balancing Act:** The software finds a sweet spot between **quality and file size**. More compression = lower quality, but still looks good at a reasonable level.

## 🔥 **What "Patterns" Really Means**

When they say **"finding patterns"** in the context of **compression**, it's not exactly the same as just "ways or styles". It's more about finding **repeated or predictable structures** within data-things that can be **simplified or represented more efficiently**.

### So, in compression, **"patterns"** means:

- **Repetitions** - Things that appear over and over.
- **Similarities** - Parts of the image that are alike or follow a consistent structure.
- **Predictable structures** - Areas that follow a certain rule or format.

### 🌟 **Examples of Patterns in Pictures**

1. **Repeated Colors:**
   - If you have a big sky in a photo that's all the same shade of blue, it's a **huge pattern**.
   - Instead of storing `blue, blue, blue, blue...` for every single pixel, compression can just store **"1000 pixels of blue."**

2. **Smooth Gradients:**
   - When colors gradually change from one to another (like a sunset), that gradual shift is a **pattern**.
   - The compression software can use math to **approximate the gradient** rather than store every single pixel's color. This is what lossy compression like **JPEG** is great at.

3. **Repeating Textures:**
   - Think about a brick wall or grass. Even though it looks detailed, it's actually made up of **repeating units**.
   - Compression can **simplify those repeating units** into a smaller representation.

4. **Symmetry and Predictable Shapes:**
   - When there's symmetry or predictable shapes (like a checkerboard pattern or repeating logo), compression can **encode the pattern itself rather than each individual block**.

### 🧩 **Why Patterns Matter for Compression**

- By **finding these patterns**, the software can **store them in a simpler way** instead of saving **every single detail**.
- It's like **writing a shortcut instead of repeating the same thing over and over**.

For example, instead of storing:
```
1111111111 (10 pixels of white)
```
It can just store:
```
10x1 (which means 10 pixels of 1, way shorter!)
```
This trick is called **Run-Length Encoding (RLE)**, a basic type of compression.

## 🌟 **Why the professor called the output a "side effect"**:

It's actually a **programming concept**. And it's important to understand, especially as you get deeper into coding.

### 🔥 **What's a "Side Effect" in Programming?**

In programming, a **"side effect"** is when a function or block of code **does something beyond just returning a value**. It **changes something in the environment** or **produces some visible effect**, like printing text or modifying a file.

### 📌 **Examples of Side Effects:**

- **Printing something to the screen:**  
  ```python
  print("Hello, World!")  # This is a side effect because it changes what you see on the screen.
  ```
- **Changing a global variable:**  
  ```python
  count = 0

  def increment():
      global count
      count += 1
  ```
  When `increment()` is called, it **changes `count`**, which is outside the function itself. That's a side effect!

- **Writing to a file or changing a database:**  
  ```python
  with open("hello.txt", "w") as file:
      file.write("You are amazing!")
  ```
  It **modifies a file on your computer**-totally a side effect!

### 🌟 **Why It's Called a "Side Effect" Instead of a "Direct Effect"**

The term **"side effect"** comes from **Functional Programming**, where functions are supposed to be **pure**. Meaning:

- They **take inputs** and **return outputs** without changing anything outside of themselves.
- If a function **prints something, changes a variable, or modifies a file**, it's considered a "side effect" because **it affects something outside the function's own little world**.

💡 **Imagine a hacker writing a script**-if the script just returns a number, that's pure. But if it changes files or sends messages across a network? Those are side effects. And hackers love side effects.

## 🌟 **Why Does the Sprite Turn 180 Degrees?**

![scraper](/assets/img/posts/scraper_turn180.png)

The **Yale sprite** (or any sprite in Scratch) needs to turn **180 degrees** because it's **bouncing off the wall**.

### 🔥 **Here's why:**

- The sprite is **moving in one direction** (let's say to the right).
- If it **touches the right wall**, it needs to **turn around and go the opposite direction** (to the left).
- Similarly, if it's moving **left** and **touches the left wall**, it needs to **turn around and go to the right**.
- The most straightforward way to **reverse direction** is to **turn 180 degrees**-a complete **about-face**.

### 💡 **Think of It Like This:**

- Imagine you're **walking straight** and you bump into a wall. You don't just **slide along the wall** or **turn slightly**-you **completely turn around** and walk the other way.  
- That's exactly what the sprite does:  
  - **Hits the wall** → **Flips direction by 180 degrees** → **Keeps moving**.

### 🌀 **Why Not Just Turn 90 Degrees?**

- If the sprite only turned **90 degrees**, it would **move along the wall** rather than bouncing back.
- The point of the **180-degree turn** is to **reverse the direction** completely.

### 🔥 **There's a difference between:**

1. **Flipping the Direction (Rotating the Direction)** ✅  
2. **Flipping the Sprite Itself (Upside Down)** ❌

#### 🌟 **What's Happening Here (Rotating the Direction):**

- When you tell the sprite to **"turn 180 degrees"** in Scratch, you're just **changing the direction it's moving**, NOT flipping its appearance. 
- Think of it like an **invisible arrow pointing the way** the sprite is traveling. That arrow is just being **flipped around**.

**Example:**

- If the sprite was moving right (**direction = 90 degrees**), turning it 180 degrees would make it move **left (direction = -90 or 270 degrees)**.
- The sprite itself looks exactly the same-no upside-down madness. 🙃

#### 🌟 **Flipping the Sprite Itself (Upside Down):**

- This would mean **literally flipping the image** like it was rotated by **180 degrees visually**.
- Imagine if your sprite is a little cat 🐱-doing a visual flip would make the cat **look like it's upside down**.
- **Scratch usually doesn't do this unless you specifically ask it to.** In most cases, it just changes **the direction of motion** without altering how the sprite looks.

#### 💡 **How Scratch Handles It:**

- In Scratch, sprites have a setting called **"Rotation Style."**
  - **"All Around"** - Allows full rotation (this is where your sprite might flip upside down if not careful).
  - **"Left-Right"** - Only mirrors left or right, not upside down.
  - **"Don't Rotate"** - Sprite always faces the same way but moves in different directions.
- Your sprite is probably set to **"Left-Right"**, which means **turning 180 degrees** just **makes it move the opposite way** without changing the appearance.

## 🌟 **Difference Between the Two Blocks**

These two Scratch blocks are *almost* doing the same thing, but there's a **key difference** in how they **output the result**.

### 🔥 **First Image (Using "say" block)**

- **Block Used:** `say`
- **Output Type:** **Visual Text** (Speech Bubble)
- **What It Does:**
  - When you run the script, it **asks the user** for their name.
  - After the user answers, the sprite **displays** "Hello, [Name]" as **text in a speech bubble** on the screen.
- **Where It Shows:** **On the screen, visible to the user.**
- **Use Case:** Good when you want **visual interaction** but not actual sound.

### 🔥 **Second Image (Using "speak" block)**

- **Block Used:** `speak`
- **Output Type:** **Audio Output** (Computer-generated voice)
- **What It Does:**
  - When you run the script, it **asks the user** for their name.
  - After the user answers, the sprite **speaks aloud** "Hello, [Name]" using the computer's **text-to-speech** feature.
- **Where It Shows:** **You hear it, but you don't see it visually.**
- **Use Case:** Perfect when you want to **make your sprite talk** or add a voice element to your project.

### 🔑 **The Point Is:**

- **"Say" = Visual Output** (speech bubble, like a text message).  
- **"Speak" = Audio Output** (actual voice, like it's talking to you).  

Both are useful depending on what you're trying to build. 😊 If you're making a **text-based adventure game**, the `say` block is cool. But if you want to make something feel **alive or interactive**, using `speak` makes it way more fun. 🎤✨

## 🌟 **What "Point in direction 90" Means**

In **Scratch**, when you **set a direction using a number**, it's based on a **coordinate system where directions are represented by angles**. 📐

### 🔥 **Direction Numbers in Scratch:**

- **0°** → **Up** (Straight up, north) ⬆️  
- **90°** → **Right** (Straight to the right, east) ➡️  
- **180°** → **Down** (Straight down, south) ⬇️  
- **-90°** or **270°** → **Left** (Straight to the left, west) ⬅️  

So, when you write:  

```scratch
point in direction 90
```

You are telling the sprite to **face and move to the right**. ➡️

### 💡 **Why It's Important in Your Code:**

- **"Point in direction 90"** is setting the sprite's initial direction **to the right**.
- So, when you start the script, your sprite will **begin by moving to the right until it hits a wall**.
- After it hits a wall, it **flips 180 degrees** and moves in the opposite direction (left).  
  - If it hits the left wall, it flips **180 degrees** and heads **right** again.

It's all about making sure the sprite **starts moving in the intended direction**. If you changed it to `0` instead, it would start **moving up** instead of right. 🚀

## Have fun in CS50!
