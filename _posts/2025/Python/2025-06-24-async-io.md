## Asynchronous Chess Exhibition

I have a question about the example in [Miguel Grinberg Asynchronous Python for the Complete Beginner PyCon 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG6fr81xHKA&t=269s){:target="_blank"} or [Async IO in Python: A Complete Walkthrough](https://realpython.com/async-io-python/#async-io-explained){:target="_blank"}:

> "Why is it `120 * 30`, based on *Judit's moves*, and not something like `(55 - 5) * 30 * 24` or similar-since the **opponents also spend time** thinking?"

---

### TLDR

Because in the **asynchronous** setup, **Judit is the bottleneck**, *not the opponents*.
The whole system is pipelined-**parallelized**-so her pacing determines the total duration.
The opponents think **during the time she's playing others**.

---

### In the asynchronous version

* Judit goes from table to table:

  * Move ‚Üí move ‚Üí move ‚Üí ‚Ä¶ ‚Üí 24 tables.
  * That takes her `24 * 5 = 120s` (2 minutes per full round of 24 boards).
* During those 120s, every opponent has time to think **while she's not at their table**.

### One game needs

* **30 moves by Judit**.
* **30 moves by the opponent**.

BUT! Each pair-move cycle looks like this:

1. Judit moves on table 1.
2. She moves on tables 2-24.
3. Meanwhile, player 1 thinks.
4. 120s later, she's back to table 1.

So every opponent gets **120 seconds of think time** before she returns.

And we assume earlier, opponents only need **55 seconds** to move. So even if Judit takes just 120s per round, the **opponents are always ready** with their next move when she comes back.

They don't delay her. So:

> Total time = Judit's total effort  
> `= 30 moves/game * 120s/move cycle = 3600 seconds`  
> `= 1 hour`  

---

### Why `(55 - 5) * 30 * 24` idea doesn't apply

`(55 - 5)` would imply opponents *need extra time* **after Judit moves**, but there's **no idle time** between Judit moving and the opponent thinking-the wait time **is already overlapped** while Judit is off playing others.

So multiplying by 24 is unnecessary because the **time isn't additive**, it's **overlapping**.

---

## Analogy: "Judit the Pizza Delivery Queen"

Judit is delivering pizza to 24 friends.

* She spends 5 seconds at each house (making her move).
* Each friend eats for 55 seconds (thinking about their move).
* She makes the full delivery route in 120 seconds (2 mins).
* Every time she returns to a house, the friend has finished eating and is ready again.

So she just keeps looping.

The total time is just how long she takes to **cycle 30 times**. Not 30√ó24 times.

## Understand Concurrency, Parallelism, Threading, Multiprocessing

| Concept             | Keyword                       | Think of it like...                           | Best for       |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| **Concurrency**     | "Overlapping"                 | Juggling tasks (even if 1-at-a-time)          | IO-bound work  |
| **Parallelism**     | "Simultaneous"                | 24 bakers baking 24 cakes *at once*           | CPU-bound work |
| **Threading**       | "Multiple threads in 1 brain" | Switching between thoughts really fast        | IO-bound       |
| **Multiprocessing** | "Multiple brains"             | 24 people each thinking hard at the same time | CPU-bound      |

---

### Cute Kitchen Analogy

You are baking 3 cakes üßÅüßÅüßÅ 

Each one

* Needs 10 minutes in the oven (IO-bound)
* Needs 1 minute of intense decorating (CPU-bound)

Now let's explore what happens in different models:

---

#### 1. **Threading** = You have multiple *hands*, but still *one brain* (Python process)

* You put Cake A in oven, then Cake B, then Cake C.
* While A is baking, you decorate B. Then switch to C.
* You never bake *2 at once*, but you **juggle** between them without sitting idle.

**Great for I/O-heavy tasks** (waiting for oven = waiting for file/net/db).

Still one brain (process), just *juggling faster*. But in Python, GIL says "only one thread at a time runs Python bytecode." So threading's good only when you wait on stuff (IO).

---

#### 2. **Multiprocessing** = You clone yourself. Now **3 you*s*** baking 3 cakes

* Each one has their own oven, own spatula, own brain.
* You all bake and decorate at once.

**Great for CPU-heavy stuff** - like video rendering, crunching numbers, encrypting data.

Python creates **separate processes** (no GIL!). But heavier on memory.

---

#### 3. **Concurrency** = Not about *how many CPUs*, it's about being smart with *time*

* You only have 1 brain, 1 oven. But you manage time well.
* You bake Cake A, then **while it's in oven**, switch to Cake B, then C, etc.
* You don't "do multiple things *at the same nanosecond*", but they **overlap in progress**.

So concurrency is about *task scheduling*, not raw CPU force.

---

#### 4. **Parallelism** = Tasks run at the **exact same time** on multiple CPUs

* Like you and your twin are both decorating cakes at the same time.

Or another example: **Listening to music while reading docs**

<iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/1KWt1O0TZcdCkg3WIvkQaK?utm_source=generator" width="100%" height="152" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe>

Click this "Play" button, then you are doing **Parallelism** while reading this post.

Two totally separate things happening **at the exact same time**, handled by different "processors" (brain/audio center vs. brain/reading center). It's like your OS running the **music player on Core 1**, and **Firefox on Core 2**.

Think examples like real-time simulations, machine learning model training, etc.

### Python Weirdness: the GIL

Python (specifically **CPython**) has a **GIL (Global Interpreter Lock)**.

This prevents multiple threads from running Python code at the same time. BUT you *can* do concurrent IO using threading. AND multiprocessing bypasses the GIL.

So:

| Task type                     | Best tool in Python                                         |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Web scraping, file read/write | `threading`, `asyncio`                                      |
| Heavy math, video processing  | `multiprocessing`, `concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor` |

---

### In Code

#### Threading example

```python
import threading

def download_file():
    print("Downloading...")

threads = []
for _ in range(10):
    t = threading.Thread(target=download_file)
    threads.append(t)
    t.start()
```

#### Multiprocessing example

```python
from multiprocessing import Process

def crunch_data():
    print("Processing...")

procs = []
for _ in range(4):
    p = Process(target=crunch_data)
    procs.append(p)
    p.start()
```

## async IO & coroutines

| Concept      | Concurrent?    | Parallel? | Threads? | Processes? |
| ------------ | -------------- | -------  | -------- | ---------- |
| `async IO`   | Yes            | No       | No (just 1 thread)     | No       |
| `coroutines` | (if scheduled) | No       | No (just 1 thread)     | No       |

> **Async IO is concurrent**, but **not parallel**.
> Coroutines are **units of async code**, and **they run one at a time**, but can *pause* for others.

---

## What's async IO doing?

Picture this:

You are alone in your room. You can only do **one thing at a time**. But you're a **super multitasker**, so when you're *waiting* on something (like food delivery or file download), you **start doing something else** immediately (like coding).

That's **async IO**:

**1 thread**, **1 process**. It **pretends** to be multitasking by **pausing & switching** tasks cleverly. Not by using threads or CPUs-but by using **coroutines** that can *pause*.

---

## What is a coroutine?

A **coroutine** is like a Python function that can **pause** and say:

> "Hey scheduler, I'm waiting for something (e.g., network reply), go let someone else run while I chill."

So you're not running in parallel like multiprocessing; you're **sharing a single thread** - just taking turns. That's why it's called **Cooperative multitasking** - all coroutines must *behave and yield* when they're waiting.

---

## Are coroutines concurrent?

**Yes**, but **only with async scheduling**.

Coroutines are *not inherently concurrent*. They're just special functions with the ability to pause. But when you **await** them inside an `async def`, and use something like `asyncio.run()`, then you're **scheduling them concurrently**.

```python
import asyncio

async def cook():
    print("üç≥ Cooking started")
    await asyncio.sleep(2)
    print("üç≥ Cooking done")

async def eat():
    print("üçΩÔ∏è Eating started")
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
    print("üçΩÔ∏è Eating done")

async def main():
    await asyncio.gather(cook(), eat())

asyncio.run(main())
```

### Output

```txt
üç≥ Cooking started
üçΩÔ∏è Eating started
üçΩÔ∏è Eating done
üç≥ Cooking done
```

Even though both functions run on **1 thread**, they **interleave** thanks to `await`.
