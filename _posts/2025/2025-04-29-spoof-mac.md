## **What is Network Interface Card (NIC)?**

Think of the **NIC** as a tiny little magical *door* in your computer:

- It lets your computer **talk** to the outside world.
- It could be a **Wi-Fi card** (for wireless) 📡 or **Ethernet card** (for cable internet) 🖧.

Every NIC has:

- A **MAC address** (like its own permanent tattoo, unique for each card 💉)
- A way to send/receive data frames.

You don't "feel" it because it just sits inside your device doing its job like a loyal bodyguard 🛡️,  
but **without it, your computer would be completely cut off** from the network. 😱

---

## 🛠️ **Where is the NIC in real life?**

- **On a laptop**:
  ➔ The **Wi-Fi card** *inside* is the **NIC**!  
  ➔ It's usually a **tiny little chip** attached to the motherboard.  
  ➔ You can't see it without opening the laptop.
  
- **On a desktop PC**:
  ➔ If you're using **Ethernet cable**,  
  the **Ethernet port** (where you plug in the cable) is part of the NIC!
  ➔ Sometimes it's **built into the motherboard** (onboard NIC).  
  ➔ Sometimes it's a **separate expansion card** you plug into the PCIe slot. 
    - e.g. Mine was `Realtek PCIe GbE Family Controller`.

- **External NIC**:
  ➔ If you ever use a **USB Wi-Fi adapter** (a little dongle you plug into your laptop),  
  that's also technically a Network Interface Card! 🔌✨

---

### 🎯 **In short:**

- It's always there quietly inside your computer.  
- It's **hardware** + **firmware** combined.
- It's the magical piece that **connects** you to Wi-Fi or wired Internet.

You **use** it every second you're online, but **you just don't see it** - like your heartbeat. 🫀

---

## 🌟 Step-by-step: How to find your Network Interface Card (NIC) in Device Manager

1. In `Device Manager`, find this folder:  
   ➔ `Network Adapters`

2. Click to expand `Network Adapters`.  
   Inside, you will see something like:

   - Your **Ethernet card** (if you have a cable plug port)
   - Your **Wi-Fi card** (for wireless connections)
   - Maybe even **VPN adapters** (virtual ones installed by apps)

---

### 🌈 What will you see?

Usually the NIC will be listed like:

- **Intel(R) Ethernet Controller** 
- **Realtek PCIe GbE Family Controller** 
- **Intel(R) Wi-Fi 6 AX201** 
- **Killer Wireless AX1650i** 

If it's a gaming laptop or motherboard, it might even be a **Killer NIC** or **AX200/AX201** Wi-Fi!

---

## 🖥️💬 **Find your MAC address in 2 clicks (simple way):**

1.  
👉 Open you **`Window Terminal(admin)`**

(*No worries if it's not admin, normal "Windows Terminal" also OK for now.*)

2.  
Type this magical command:

```bash
getmac
```

Then hit `Enter`. 🚀

---

🌟 **What you will see:**

- A list of devices (your Realtek NIC will be there).
- Next to it, you'll see something like:

```
08-00-27-4B-2A-8C
```

This is your **MAC address**!  
(**Six pairs of hex numbers**, separated by dashes.)

💬 It's your **network hardware's fingerprint** - globally unique unless spoofed.

---

### 🐾 Extra pro way (optional, if you wanna dig deeper):

Instead of `getmac`, you can also type:

```bash
ipconfig /all
```

Then scroll down to find your NIC device which you've seen in `Device Manager`.  
Under it, you'll find a line like:

```
Physical Address. . . . . . . . . : 08-00-27-4B-2A-8C
```

That's also your MAC address! Same thing. 💖

## 🌟 **Why Should You Know How to Spoof MAC Address?**

> (even if you don't use it all the time)

1. **🛡️ Privacy Protection:**  
When you connect to Wi-Fi (especially public Wi-Fi), your real MAC address can be logged and tracked.  
**Spoofing it makes you "anonymous"** - like wearing a different mask every time you show up. 🎭

2. **🕵️‍♀️ Bypass MAC Filters:**  
Some networks *only* allow specific MAC addresses to connect.  
By spoofing, you can pretend to be an allowed device.

3. **🔁 Resetting Free Wi-Fi Limits:**  
At coffee shops, airports, etc., they often give you "1 hour free per device" - based on your MAC.  
Spoof it = 💥 get another fresh session.

4. **🚪 Evade Device Bans:**  
If a network blocks your MAC because they hate you (lol), you can change your MAC and **reappear like a ghost** 👻.

5. **💻 Hacker Basic Skill:**  
It's considered **basic hacker hygiene** -  
**Always hide your true hardware ID** when testing networks, doing CTFs (Capture the Flag), or *sensitive activities*.

## 🖥️✨ **Steps to Spoof MAC Address**

We'll do it via **Registry + Device Restart**.

### 🐾 Step 1: Find your NIC name exactly

I'll give example with mine:  
> **Realtek PCIe GbE Family Controller**

*(If you forgot, you can always type `wmic nic get name, index` to check.)*

---

### 🐾 Step 2: Open Registry Editor

1. Press `Win + R`,  
2. Type:

```
regedit
```

and hit Enter.

**(Say YES if it asks admin permission.)**

---

### 🐾 Step 3: Navigate to NIC settings

Follow this path:

```
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Class\{4d36e972-e325-11ce-bfc1-08002be10318}
```

*I'll explain what is `{4d36e972-e325-11ce-bfc1-08002be10318}` later.*

🚀 Now you'll see many folders like `0000`, `0001`, `0002`...  
Each one represents a network adapter.

---

### 🐾 Step 4: Find your Realtek one

- Click each numbered folder (`0000`, `0001`, etc.)
- Look at the **right panel**.
- Find `DriverDesc` = **Realtek PCIe GbE Family Controller**

When you find it - THAT'S your NIC's registry spot!

---

### 🐾 Step 5: Add a "NetworkAddress" key

1. In the **right panel**,  
Right-click ➔ `New` ➔ `String Value`.

2. Name it exactly:

```
NetworkAddress
```

3. Double-click it ➔ In **Value Data**, type your new MAC address.  
(No dashes, no spaces. Only 12 hex characters.)

Example:

```
001122334455
```

*(No ":" or "-". Just pure numbers/letters.)*

---

### 🐾 Step 6: Restart NIC

Now open **Device Manager** →  
Right-click your Realtek NIC → Disable → Enable again.

Or just reboot your PC.

After that - BOOM! 🎯
Your MAC address is officially **spoofed**!

---

### 🐾 Example flow:

| Step | What you put |
|:----|:----|
| Value name | NetworkAddress |
| Value data | 001122334455 |

---

### 🧡 Important Warnings:

- If you want to reset to your real MAC, just delete that `NetworkAddress` field and reboot.
- Make sure your fake MAC starts with an even number (0, 2, 4, 6, 8, A, C, E) to stay "unicast."
- Don't use all-zero MACs.
- This method (using Registry + "NetworkAddress") is semi-permanent.
    - It will NOT reset after reboot!
    - Even when you restart, your Windows will still keep using the spoofed MAC address you wrote in the registry. 🎯

## 🌟 What is `{4d36e972-e325-11ce-bfc1-08002be10318}`?

That long ugly `{}` thing is called a **GUID** (Globally Unique Identifier).  
It's like a "magic code" that Windows uses to identify certain **types** of devices - no matter the brand, model, whatever.

And *specifically*:

| GUID | Represents |
|:-----|:-----------|
| `{4d36e972-e325-11ce-bfc1-08002be10318}` | **Network Adapters** |

✨ **Always. Always. Always.**  
When Windows sees `{4d36e972...}`, it knows:  
> "Aha! These are Network Interface Cards (NICs)!"

---

### 🌟 Why are there so many folders with the same GUID?

Because inside the NIC category (`{4d36e972...}`),  
there are **many different physical and virtual adapters** installed on your system!  

Each folder like `0000`, `0001`, `0002`, etc., is a **different device** under **Network Adapters**.

- `0000` might be your Realtek wired NIC.
- `0001` might be your Bluetooth PAN device.
- `0002` might be your WireSock virtual VPN adapter.
- etc.

They all fall under the same family (`{4d36e972...}`),  
but each one is **a different actual network device**.

---
 
The path:

```
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Class\{4d36e972-e325-11ce-bfc1-08002be10318}
```

always leads to **network adapters**.

Inside there, you **have to manually check each number (0000, 0001, 0002...)**  
and find **which one matches your Realtek device**.

### 🌈 **Simple visualization:**

| Registry Part | Meaning |
|:--------------|:--------|
| `{4d36e972-e325-11ce-bfc1-08002be10318}` | All network devices |
| `0000`, `0001`, `0002`... | Different NICs (Ethernet, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, VPN...) |
| `DriverDesc` | Tells you which is which (Realtek / Intel / Killer Wireless etc.) |

---

## 🌟 Mission: **Automate MAC Spoofing With a Tiny Script**

(💬: This will make you change your MAC in 1 second, without digging into Registry manually every time.)

### 🛠️ Step 1: Preparation

We'll make a **simple `.bat` (Batch) script** to:

- Write a new fake MAC into Registry,
- Restart your NIC,
- Boom! New identity. 🎭

---

#### ✨ Script structure overview:

```bat
@echo off
SET MAC=00E011223344
SET NICNAME="Ethernet"

:: Write MAC address to registry
reg add "HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Class\{4d36e972-e325-11ce-bfc1-08002be10318}\0000" /v NetworkAddress /d %MAC% /f

:: Disable NIC
wmic path win32_networkadapter where "NetConnectionID=%NICNAME%" call disable

timeout /t 3 /nobreak

:: Enable NIC
wmic path win32_networkadapter where "NetConnectionID=%NICNAME%" call enable

timeout /t 3 /nobreak

ipconfig /all
pause
```

---

#### 🌈 Customize for YOUR machine:

| Field | What to Put |
|:------|:------------|
| `MAC` | Your new fake MAC address (no `:` or `-`, just 12 hex characters) |
| `NICNAME` | The name of your NIC as shown in `Network Connections` (like "Ethernet" or custom) |
| `{4d36e972-e325-11ce-bfc1-08002be10318}\0000` | Adjust `0000`, `0001`, etc., based on which Registry folder matches your Realtek device |

#### 💬 How to always find the correct NICNAME?

- Open `ipconfig /all`
- Look at the line after `Ethernet adapter`, `Wireless adapter`, `Bluetooth adapter`
- **The text after the colon (`:`)** is your NICNAME.
- (And you MUST use double quotes `" "` in your script if the NICNAME has **spaces** or **Chinese**!)

---

### 🎨 Step 2: Save the script

1. Open **Notepad**.
2. Paste the full script.
3. Save as:

```
spoof_mac.bat
```

Make sure you choose **Save as type: All Files** and not `.txt`.

4. Right-click ➔ **Run as administrator**.

---

### 🎯 What will happen:

- Script changes your MAC in registry 💎
- Script disables the NIC 🔌
- Script waits 3 seconds ⏳
- Script enables the NIC again 🔥
- Script shows your new MAC live 🚀

---

### 🌟 **When you run:**

```bash
reg add "..." /v NetworkAddress /d 001122334455 /f
```

it means:

| Option | Meaning |
|:-------|:--------|
| `/v NetworkAddress` | Target the **value named `NetworkAddress`** |
| `/d 001122334455` | **Data** you want to put inside (the new MAC) |
| `/f` | **Force overwrite** - if it already exists, **replace it** without asking |

---

#### 🖤 **Result:**

- If `NetworkAddress` already exists, it gets **overwritten** with your new MAC address.
- If `NetworkAddress` doesn't exist yet, it gets **created** with your new MAC address.
- **There will always be exactly one `NetworkAddress`** under your NIC's registry folder (0000, 0001, etc.), not duplicated or messy.

Every time you run this script:

- One single clean value,
- New MAC,
- No leftovers,
- No confusion. 🎯💻
