## `rm`-Related Commands

### 💻 In **Bash / Linux / macOS Terminal**:

| Command | What it does |
|--------|--------------|
| `rm filename` | Deletes a file (may ask for confirmation if aliased to `rm -i`) |
| `rm -f filename` | Force delete, no confirmation - even if write-protected |
| `rm -i filename` | Interactive delete - always asks "are you sure?" |
| `rm -r foldername` | Recursively deletes a folder and everything inside |
| `rm -rf foldername` | **Dangerous**: Recursive + force - Delete everything inside the folder, and then delete the folder itself |
| `\rm filename` | Runs the raw rm (no alias), which deletes without asking, unless the file is protected |

---

### 💻 In **PowerShell** (Windows):

| Command | What it does |
|--------|--------------|
| `rm filename` | Alias for `Remove-Item` |
| `rm -Recurse -Force foldername` | PowerShell equivalent of `rm -rf` |
| `Remove-Item -Recurse -Force foldername` | Full version, same as above |

🧠 PowerShell **does NOT support** Unix-style flags like `-rf`, so `rm -rf` will cause an error.

---

### 💋 Rule of Thumb:

| Situation | What to use |
|-----------|-------------|
| Want to be cautious? | `rm -i` or `rm` (with alias) |
| Need speed but safe zone? | `rm -rf` **inside test folders only** |
| On PowerShell? | `rm -Recurse -Force` |
| Wanna look cool in front of your hacker bf? | Use `\rm` to flex unaliased power 😏

## Scrabble

### 💥 Problem:

In `compute_score()` function:

```c
int pos = toupper(word[i] - 'A');
```

This is actually doing:

1. `word[i] - 'A'` first (which becomes an `int`)
2. Then applying `toupper()` to that **number**, not to the character

😵‍💫 Which means, say if `word[i] = 'a'`, `'a' - 'A' = 32`,  
then `toupper(32)` is… totally invalid. You end up indexing `POINTS[?]` with a messed-up value.

---

### 💡 The Correct Way:

```c
int pos = toupper(word[i]) - 'A';
```

That's how you:

1. First turn the char to uppercase (if it's lowercase)
2. Then subtract `'A'` to get its position in `POINTS[]` (0–25)

## Readability: `Coleman-Liau index`

```markdown
Recall that the Coleman-Liau index is computed using:
`index = 0.0588 * L - 0.296 * S - 15.8`

- L is the average number of letters per 100 words in the text:
that is, the number of letters divided by the number of words, all multiplied by 100.

- S is the average number of sentences per 100 words in the text:
that is, the number of sentences divided by the number of words, all multiplied by 100.
```

### 🐷 Confusion

> Shouldn't it first divide by 100 to find out how many sets of 100 words there are in the text? Then, for every 100 words, we calculate the number of letters in each word, and then find the average number of letters?

#### 🧠 Here's the Key:

You **don't** actually need to *find how many 100-word blocks* are in the text.  
Instead, you're calculating **what the average number of letters and sentences would be *if* the text had 100 words.**

So:

#### 🔁 It's not:

> "Divide text into 100-word chunks, then analyze each."

#### ✅ It **is**:

> "Scale the letter and sentence count *as if* the text were exactly 100 words long."

---

#### 📏 The Analogy

Let's say you eat 11 cookies (words), and those cookies contain 43 chocolate chips (letters) 🍪🍫

You don't need to *bake* 100 cookies to know:
> "Hey, on **average**, my cookies have 3.9 chips each,  
> so **100 cookies would likely have 390 chips**."

Same vibe.

So:

```c
L = (letters / words) × 100
S = (sentences / words) × 100
```

Is just:  
👉 "**Average letters/sentences per word**, multiplied by 100"

---

#### 💋 TL;DR

- You're **scaling**, not chunking
- You pretend the passage is 100 words long
- Then compute **expected** letters and sentences per 100 words
- And use that to get the readability index (grade level)

---

### Example of How to Unleash the Coleman-Liau Index Spell

#### 💡 The Formula (again, but sexier):

```c
index = 0.0588 * L - 0.296 * S - 15.8
```

Where:

- **L** = average number of **letters per 100 words**
- **S** = average number of **sentences per 100 words**

---

#### 🌟 Let's Try with This Text:

> "Keira is a genius. She loves code! She writes every day."

Now let's break this baby down step by step 👇

---

#### 🧮 Step 1: Count the Elements

- **Letters**: Count every *alphabetic* character  
  > Keira (5), is (2), a (1), genius (6), She (3), loves (5), code (4), She (3), writes (6), every (5), day (3)  
  → `Total letters = 43`

- **Words**: Just count by spaces + 1  
  → `Total words = 11`

- **Sentences**: Each `.`, `!`, `?` counts  
  → "Keira is a genius." `+` "She loves code!" `+` "She writes every day."  
  → `Total sentences = 3`

---

#### 🧠 Step 2: Plug into L and S

- **L =** (Letters / Words) × 100 = (43 / 11) × 100 = `390.91`
- **S =** (Sentences / Words) × 100 = (3 / 11) × 100 = `27.27`

---

#### 🔮 Step 3: Drop it in the Magic Formula

```c
index = 0.0588 * 390.91 - 0.296 * 27.27 - 15.8
index = 22.98 - 8.07 - 15.8
index ≈ -0.89
```

🎯 Final result: **Grade 1**

(We round index to nearest integer: `-0.89 → 1`)

---

### 🥰 In Summary:

| Component     | Value       |
|---------------|-------------|
| Letters       | 43          |
| Words         | 11          |
| Sentences     | 3           |
| L             | 390.91      |
| S             | 27.27       |
| Coleman Index | ≈ -0.89 → 1 |

## Caesar

### How it Works?

#### 🧠 Step 1: The Formula

The Caesar cipher formula is:

```text
cᵢ = (pᵢ + k) % 26
```

Where:

- `pᵢ` is the **number** (index) of the `i-th` letter of the original plaintext message.
- `k` is the **key**, how many positions you're rotating the alphabet.
- `cᵢ` is the new letter's **number** (index) in the ciphertext.

The `% 26` is just to make sure you **wrap around** the alphabet if you go past Z (since there are 26 letters).

---

#### 🧾 Step 2: What They Mean by That Second Paragraph

They're mapping each **letter** to a **number**.

| Letter | Index |
|--------|--------|
| A      | 0      |
| B      | 1      |
| C      | 2      |
| ...    | ...    |
| H      | 7      |
| I      | 8      |
| Z      | 25     |

---

#### 💌 Now Let's Do That *Hi* Example Like Lovers Solving It Together:

Plaintext: `Hi`  
Key: `k = 3`

##### 🔹 Step A: Convert `H` → `p₀ = 7`  

Apply the formula:

```
c₀ = (7 + 3) % 26 = 10
```

Index 10 is `K` 💡

##### 🔹 Step B: Convert `i` → `p₁ = 8`  

Apply the formula:

```
c₁ = (8 + 3) % 26 = 11
```

Index 11 is `L` 💡

So:

```text
Plaintext:   H  i
Indexes:     7  8
+ key (3):   ↓  ↓
Ciphertext:  K  L
```

Boom 🔥 That's how you encrypt "Hi" to "KL" using Caesar cipher with key `k = 3`.

---

### 💡 Q: How to convert from `string` → `int` in C?

Let's say you got this from the user:

```c
string input = get_string("Enter a number: ");
```

Now you want to turn that `input` (which is a `string`) into a real number you can do math with - like add, subtract, or... encrypt 👀

---

#### ✅ Use `atoi()` (ASCII to Integer)

```c
#include <stdlib.h>  // needed for atoi()

int number = atoi(input);
```

🔥 So easy, right? Here's a full dreamy example:

```c
#include <cs50.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main(void)
{
    string input = get_string("Enter a number: ");
    int number = atoi(input);

    printf("Your number + 10 is: %i\n", number + 10);
}
```

---

##### 🚨 But Wait-Is the Input Actually a Number?

Because if your sweet little user types something like `"banana"`, `atoi("banana")` will just give `0` without warning. 😬

If you want to be a classy programmer, you should use:

---

#### ✅ `strtol()` - the Safer, Sexier Version 🍷

```c
char *endptr;
long number = strtol(input, &endptr, 10);

if (*endptr == '\0')  // good: entire string was a number
{
    printf("Valid number: %ld\n", number);
}
else
{
    printf("Oops, not a valid number!\n");
}
```

`strtol()` lets you check if **everything** was a digit, not just the first part. 🧐

---

#### 💋 TL;DR

| Method   | What it does     | Safe? |
|----------|------------------|-------|
| `atoi()` | Fast & simple     | ❌ nope, no error handling  
| `strtol()` | Safer & flexible | ✅ yes

### Understand `strtol()`

#### 🧠 Step 1: `strtol()` in simple words

The function:

```c
long number = strtol(input, &endptr, 10);
```

means:

> "Take `input`, try to turn it into a number (base 10),  
> and if **anything couldn't be converted**, tell me **where you stopped**."

🔮 **Translation:**  
`endptr` becomes a pointer to **the first character after the number**.

---

##### 💡 Now About `char *endptr;`

- `char *endptr;`  
  → declares a pointer to a character.

- After `strtol()`, `endptr` points inside your original string **where the number parsing stopped**.

Example:

| Input String | What `endptr` points to after `strtol()` |
|--------------|------------------------------------------|
| `"1234"`     | points to `'\0'` (end of string)          |
| `"1234abc"`  | points to `'a'`                          |
| `"abc123"`   | points to `'a'` (couldn't even parse)     |

---

#### 🌈 Step 2: Why `if (*endptr == '\0')` Means "Valid Number"

Because:

- If **the whole string** was a valid number (e.g., `"1234"`),  
  parsing stops at the **end** of the string - the `'\0'` (null terminator).

- If parsing stops **before the end** (e.g., at `'a'` in `"1234abc"`),  
  it means:  
  > "Heyyy, some garbage characters after the number."

✅ So:

```c
if (*endptr == '\0')
```

means:
> "You successfully parsed the *whole* string into a number without leftover junk."

🚫 But if `*endptr != '\0'`:
> "Parsing stopped early - invalid stuff is still there."

---

#### 🧪 Visual Example

Suppose:

```c
char input[] = "1234abc";
char *endptr;
long number = strtol(input, &endptr, 10);
```

Inside memory:

| Address | Content |
|---------|---------|
| `input[0]` | `'1'` |
| `input[1]` | `'2'` |
| `input[2]` | `'3'` |
| `input[3]` | `'4'` |
| `input[4]` | `'a'` |
| `input[5]` | `'b'` |
| `input[6]` | `'c'` |
| `input[7]` | `'\0'` |

After calling `strtol()`, `endptr` now points to `input[4]` - the `'a'`.  
And `*endptr == 'a'`, NOT `'\0'`. So the input was invalid.

---

#### 💋 TL;DR

| Concept                     | Meaning                                 |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| `strtol(input, &endptr, 10)` | Parse number, store where parsing stopped |
| `endptr`                     | Points to where parsing *stopped*         |
| `*endptr == '\0'`             | Means "good, full string was parsed"      |
| `*endptr != '\0'`             | Means "bad, extra junk in input"          |

## Substitution

### 🍯 What Does `int seen[26] = {0};` Mean Exactly?

It's two parts:

#### 1. `int seen[26];`

This **creates an array** of 26 `int` numbers.

Each element can store an integer like `0`, `1`, `2`, etc.

**But!**  
C (the language) doesn't automatically set memory to zero for you when you create an array this way - it could contain random garbage if you don't initialize it. 😱

```c
int seen[26] = {0};
```

is just like:

```python
seen = [0] * 26
```

in Python.

---

#### 2. `= {0};`

This is a **special initializer** that means:

- "Set the **first element** to `0`, and **all others to `0` too**."
- In C, if you partially initialize an array like `{0}`, the rest are automatically filled with zeros.
  
🎯 So **every element** becomes:

| seen[0] | seen[1] | seen[2] | ... | seen[25] |
|--------|---------|---------|-----|----------|
| 0      | 0       | 0       | ... | 0        |

✅ No garbage! Just clean zeros, ready to count things.

---

#### 🛠️ In Real Feelings:

Imagine you're opening a brand-new notebook 📖.  
You tell C:
> "Hey, put 26 blank pages here, all empty, so I can write down whether I've seen A, B, C... all the way to Z."

Without `{0}`, the pages might have coffee stains and messy scribbles from memory leftovers.  
**With `{0}`**, it's fresh, clean, your perfect hacker diary ✍️✨.

---

#### 📚 More Examples

If you wrote:

```c
int arr[5] = {5, 2};
```

Then:

- `arr[0] = 5`
- `arr[1] = 2`
- `arr[2] = 0`
- `arr[3] = 0`
- `arr[4] = 0`

Everything **after the listed numbers** becomes `0` automatically.

But if you wrote just:

```c
int arr[5];
```

❌ All 5 slots could be random garbage numbers like `4738`, `-2`, etc.

---

#### 💋 TL;DR 

| Code                 | Meaning                        |
|----------------------|---------------------------------|
| `int seen[26];`       | Create 26 empty int slots       |
| `int seen[26] = {0};` | Create 26 **zeroed** int slots  |
| Why `{0}`?            | To avoid random garbage memory |

---

### 🎯 How it Works? The Big Goal:

We want to **track whether a letter has already appeared** in the `key` string - no matter if it's `'A'` or `'a'`.

To do that, we use:

```c
int seen[26] = {0};
```

→ an array with 26 slots, each standing for **one letter in the alphabet**.

So:

| Index | Letter |
|-------|--------|
| 0     | A/a    |
| 1     | B/b    |
| 2     | C/c    |
| ...   | ...    |
| 25    | Z/z    |

---

#### 🧠 Step-by-Step: How It Tracks Duplicates

Let's say the user gives you this key:

```c
string s = "ABCDEFAHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ";
```

Oops! `'A'` appears **twice**.

Now watch this 🔎

#### 💻 Code:

```c
for (int i = 0; i < strlen(s); i++)
{
    if (!isalpha(s[i]))
    {
        return false;
    }

    int index = toupper(s[i]) - 'A';

    if (seen[index] > 0)
    {
        return false; // we've already seen this letter
    }

    seen[index]++;
}
```

#### 🪄 Let's Simulate It

| `i` | `s[i]` | `toupper(s[i])` | `index` | `seen[index]` Before | Seen After | Action         |
|-----|--------|------------------|--------|-----------------------|------------|----------------|
| 0   | A      | A                | 0      | 0                     | 1          | OK             |
| 1   | B      | B                | 1      | 0                     | 1          | OK             |
| 2   | C      | C                | 2      | 0                     | 1          | OK             |
| 3   | D      | D                | 3      | 0                     | 1          | OK             |
| 4   | E      | E                | 4      | 0                     | 1          | OK             |
| 5   | **F**  | **F**            | 5      | 0                     | 1          | OK             |
| 6   | **A**  | **A**            | 0      | **1**                 | -          | ❌ DUPLICATE!  |

Once we try to check `'A'` again, `seen[0]` is already `1`.  
BOOM 💣 - we found a duplicate. Return `false`.

---

#### 💡 The Core Magic:

This line:

```c
int index = toupper(s[i]) - 'A';
```

turns `'A'` or `'a'` → `0`,  
turns `'B'` or `'b'` → `1`,  
and so on - creating a **universal tracker index** for that letter.

Then:

```c
seen[index]++;
```

is just like writing:
> "Mark that I've seen this letter now."

And:

```c
if (seen[index] > 0)
```

is like saying:
> "Wait a sec... I've **already** seen this. That's bad!"

---

#### 💋 TL;DR

- `string s` is the key you're checking.
- `seen[26]` is like 26 little flags, one per alphabet letter.
- `toupper(s[i]) - 'A'` converts the char into a number from 0-25.
- `seen[index]++` marks the letter as "seen."
- If you ever hit one that's already `> 0`, that's a duplicate 💥
