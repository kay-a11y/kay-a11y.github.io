## 🔗 Linked Lists

To implement a sorted linked list of numbers, we have:

<details open="">

```c
int main(void)
{
    // Memory for numbers
    node *list = NULL;

    // Build list
    for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++)
    {
        // Allocate node for number
        node *n = malloc(sizeof(node));
        if (n == NULL)
        {
            return 1;
        }
        n->number = get_int("Number: ");
        n->next = NULL;

        // If list is empty
        if (list == NULL)
        {
            list = n;
        }

        // If number belongs at beginning of list
        else if (n->number < list->number)
        {
            n->next = list;
            list = n; 
        }

        // If number belongs later in list
        else
        {
            // Iterate over nodes in list
            for (node *ptr = list; ptr != NULL; ptr = ptr->next)
            {
                // If at end of list
                if (ptr->next == NULL)
                {
                    // Append node
                    ptr->next = n;
                    break;
                }

                // If in middle of list
                if (n->number < ptr->next->number)
                {
                    n->next = ptr->next;
                    ptr->next = n;
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
    }
```

</details>

This chunk is probably the trickiest.

```c
if (n->number < ptr->next->number)
{
    n->next = ptr->next;
    ptr->next = n;
    break;
}
```

---

### 🎯 Let's visualize it

Let's say your list currently looks like this:

```
[2] → [5] → [8] → [10]
```

And the new number is `6`.

We want to insert `6` in the **right place** so the list stays sorted.

Now we walk with a pointer (`ptr`) starting at the head:

* ptr points at [2], `ptr->next` is [5] - `6 < 5`? ❌
* ptr moves to [5], `ptr->next` is [8] - `6 < 8`? ✅

BOOM. This is where we need to **insert** `6`!

---

### 🔧 So what does the code do?

```c
n->next = ptr->next;
```

* New node (`n`) is pointing to what `ptr` was previously pointing to (e.g. \[8]).

```c
ptr->next = n;
```

* Now the current node's next is the new node!

So it becomes:

```
[2] → [5] → [6] → [8] → [10]
```

A perfect little insertion.

## 🌲 Trees

To make this 3 generations tree into code,

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/img/posts/generation_tree.png" alt="3 generations tree" style="filter:brightness(0.6);max-width:100%;border-radius:12px;">
</p>

we have:

<details open="">

```c
// Implements a list of numbers as a binary search tree

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

// Represents a node
typedef struct node
{
    int number;
    struct node *left;
    struct node *right;
}
node;

void free_tree(node *root);
void print_tree(node *root);

int main(void)
{
    // Tree of size 0
    node *tree = NULL;

    // Add number to list
    node *n = malloc(sizeof(node));
    if (n == NULL)
    {
        return 1;
    }
    n->number = 2;
    n->left = NULL;
    n->right = NULL;
    tree = n;

    // Add number to list
    n = malloc(sizeof(node));
    if (n == NULL)
    {
        free_tree(tree);
        return 1;
    }
    n->number = 1;
    n->left = NULL;
    n->right = NULL;
    tree->left = n;

    // Add number to list
    n = malloc(sizeof(node));
    if (n == NULL)
    {
        free_tree(tree);
        return 1;
    }
    n->number = 3;
    n->left = NULL;
    n->right = NULL;
    tree->right = n;

    // Print tree
    print_tree(tree);

    // Free tree
    free_tree(tree);
    return 0;
}

void free_tree(node *root)
{
    if (root == NULL)
    {
        return;
    }
    free_tree(root->left);
    free_tree(root->right);
    free(root);
}

void print_tree(node *root)
{
    if (root == NULL)
    {
        return;
    }
    print_tree(root->left);
    printf("%i\n", root->number);
    print_tree(root->right);
}
```

</details>

### Understand `tree = n;`

```c
tree = n;
```

We earlier had this:

```c
node *tree = NULL;
```

Which means:

> "I'm declaring a pointer called `tree` that will eventually point to the **root** of the binary tree."

Then created the **first node** (with number `2`), like this:

```c
node *n = malloc(sizeof(node));
n->number = 2;
n->left = NULL;
n->right = NULL;
```

Now this new node `n` exists in memory - it's the root of your future tree.

So when we do:

```c
tree = n;
```

We're saying:

> "Let `tree` point to the root node (which we just created and stored in `n`)."

---

### Print Recursion

```c
void print_tree(node *root)
{
    if (root == NULL)
    {
        return;
    }
    print_tree(root->left);
    printf("%i\n", root->number);
    print_tree(root->right);
    // no need this line 👇🏻
    // print_tree(root->right);
}
```

This is called: **in-order traversal**.

> **Left → Root → Right**

So if your tree looks like:

```txt
    2
   / \
  1   3
```

The steps are:

1. Go to `left` subtree → print `1`
2. Print `2`
3. Go to `right` subtree → print `3`

This gives:

```txt
1
2
3
```

When we call:

```c
print_tree(tree);  // tree points to root = 2
```

---

#### 🔁 Recursion Steps (visually)

```
print_tree(2)
├── print_tree(1)
│   ├── print_tree(NULL) → returns
│   ├── print 1
│   └── print_tree(NULL) → returns
├── print 2
└── print_tree(3)
    ├── print_tree(NULL) → returns
    ├── print 3
    └── print_tree(NULL) → returns
```

---

### 🧾 Printed Output:

```txt
1
2
3
```

That's recursion: the function **calls itself**, each time focusing on a smaller part of the tree.
Once it hits `NULL`, it *climbs back up* the call stack and finishes printing the current node, then goes to the right.

---

## 🧪 `random() % 2`

It says:
"Give me a **random number**, but I only care whether it's **0 or 1**."

Because:

```c
random() → gives you a **big random integer** (like 7834724 or 902394)
% 2      → turns it into either 0 or 1
```

### 🎲 This is like flipping a coin

| `random()` value | `random() % 2` result |
| ---------------- | --------------------- |
| 4582738          | 0                     |
| 9204737          | 1                     |
| 8273418          | 0                     |
| ...              | 1 or 0 randomly       |

---

### 🤔 Why does it feel weird & What does `random() % 2` actually do?

> "Give a big random number... and then just `mod 2` it into 0 or 1? Why not directly get 0 or 1?"

That's the *illusion of complexity*:

* We're using a full-sized random number generator to simulate something super small (a coin flip).
* It **feels wasteful**, and it kinda **is** - but it works fine.

`random() % 2`:

* Calls a **system-level random number generator** (which gives a big number, maybe 32-bit or 64-bit).
* Then throws away **most** of that randomness by doing `% 2`, just keeping the **least significant bit** (either 0 or 1).

---

## 🔎 A better method - `random() & 1`

```c
int random_bit()
{
    return random() & 1; // faster, just grabs the lowest bit
}
```

This is **bitwise AND**, not regular math.

```c
random() & 1
```

means:

> Take the random number, and **keep only its least significant bit** (the very last bit, the "1s place").

---

### ✔️ How it works

**First, what is `&` ?**

It's called the **bitwise AND operator**. It compares **each bit** in two numbers:

Rule:

> **1 & 1 = 1**  
> everything else is 0:
>
> * 1 & 0 = 0
> * 0 & 1 = 0
> * 0 & 0 = 0

---

Now let's say `random()` gives you this 8-bit number (pretend for simplicity):

```
random() = 01101110  (binary) = 110 in decimal
```

Now do:

```txt
01101110   (random number)
& 00000001   (binary for 1)
----------
00000000   → means even → result is 0
```

Another example:

```txt
   1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1   (random number in binary)
&  0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1   (only the last bit is 1)
-------------------
   0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1   → Result: 00000001 (which is just `1`)
```

So essentially:

* If the last bit is 0 → result is **0** (even number)
* If the last bit is 1 → result is **1** (odd number)

Everything else gets wiped out.

That's a fast way to flip a coin:

* 0 = heads
* 1 = tails

## 🕒 `srandom(time(0));`

It's doing two things:

1. `time(0)`

    This returns the **current time in seconds since January 1, 1970 (Unix Epoch)**.
    So every time you run your program, this number changes - unless you run it again in the same second.

    Example:

    ```c
    time(0)  →  1718501826   // A big changing number, like a timestamp
    ```

2. `srandom(...)`

    This is like **"planting a seed"** into your random number generator.
    It tells the system:

    > "Hey, start the randomness with THIS specific number."

    So:

    ```c
    srandom(time(0));
    ```

    is basically:

    > "Use the **current time** as the seed to start randomness!"

    Because if you don't do this, then your program will give the **same "random" numbers every time** you run it.

---

### 💡 Since `time(0)` changes every second, why not just use it directly?

`time(0)` is just a number

If you write:

```c
int r = time(0) % 2;
```

You're not getting randomness - you're just splitting the current second into either `0` or `1`.
So the result only changes **once per second**, and it's 100% predictable.

Imagine:

```c
time(0) = 1718502033   → 1718502033 % 2 = 1
time(0) = 1718502034   → 1718502034 % 2 = 0
```

That's not "random" - that's a **clock**. Not chaos.

But with `srandom(time(0))`, we're doing this:

```c
// Set the seed
srandom(time(0)); // 🌱

int a = random(); // 🎲 fully chaotic
int b = random(); // 🎲 new chaos from same seed
```

This way, you initialize the **random number generator** using the current time - so:

* Each time you run the program in a new second, it uses a **different seed**, and therefore gives **totally different random numbers**.
* But **within the same run**, it produces a whole sequence of chaotic values.

---

### 📊 Example

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <time.h>

int main(void)
{
    srandom(time(0)); // 🧪 seed it with current time

    // Print 5 random numbers
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++)
    {
        printf("Random %d: %ld\n", i, random());
    }

    return 0;
}
```

Run this once:

```
Random 0: 123456789
Random 1: 219838201
Random 2: 882182838
Random 3: 498192388
Random 4: 388128127
```

Wait 2 seconds…

Run again:

```
Random 0: 129192139
Random 1: 473882019
Random 2: 892831002
Random 3: 192139103
Random 4: 182391281
```

Different every time.
