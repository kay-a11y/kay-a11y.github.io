## C - single quote VS double quote

In **C**, when you're working with *strings*, you **must** use **double quotes**:

```c
printf("hello, world"); // ✅ correct
printf('hello, world'); // ❌ nope, this throws an error
```

That's because:

- `'a'` (single quotes) = a **single character literal**, of type `char`  
  → like: `'H'`, `'e'`, `'1'`
- `"hello"` (double quotes) = a **string literal**, of type `char[]`

In contrast:

- **JavaScript** is chill-you can use `'single'` or `"double"` quotes for strings
- **Python** is also relaxed-both work fine too, even `'''triple quotes'''` for multi-line strings

But C? That bad boy is old school and picky af. If you give it `'hello'`, it'll be like "babe, that ain't a char, that's a whole-ass string, I'm out 🫥."

So just remember:
> 💬 JS & PY: use either `'` or `"`  
> 🔐 C: **must** use `"` for strings  
> `'a'` in C is fine but only for single characters

## `get_string()` from cs50 VS `scanf()`

**`get_string()`** is a function provided by **CS50** to make things easier for beginners. Normally, in standard C, there's no `get_string()` function. You'd need to manually handle things like string input and memory allocation. But CS50 took care of that for you, so you don;t have to worry about complex details when you're just getting started. It's like training wheels for your C journey! 🚴‍♀️✨

---

### standard C 🧐

In **standard C**, if you wanted to get a string (like your name), you'd need to do it manually using **`scanf()`**. The code:

```c
char answer[100];       // Declare an array to store your string
scanf("%s", answer);    // Get user input and store it in the 'answer' array
```

Here's what this does:

1. **`char answer[100];`**  
   - This line creates an **array** of characters, called `answer`, that can hold up to 99 characters (plus one extra space for the special "null terminator" `\0` that marks the end of a string in C).
   
2. **`scanf("%s", answer);`**  
   - This line tells C to **read** input from the user (a string) and store it in the `answer` array. The `%s` format specifier is for reading a string of characters.

But there's a **catch**!  

- **`scanf("%s", answer)`** **won't** handle spaces. So, if you enter a name like `John Doe`, it will only capture `John`-it stops at the first space. 😬
- It also doesn't check for memory overflow, so you have to manually manage the size of `answer[]` and ensure you don't go beyond its bounds (dangerous in real-world code). 😱

---

### Why CS50's `get_string()` is Better:

CS50's `get_string()` does **all of this for you** in the background. You don't need to worry about buffers, overflows, or strings not handling spaces. You can just:

```c
string answer = get_string("What's your name? ");  
```

And boom, CS50 takes care of reading the whole string, even if it has spaces. It's beginner-friendly, just like CS50's philosophy-making complex things easier for you to understand and **focus on learning**.

## `rm` `rmdir` `rm -r`

When you use **`rm`** and **`rmdir`**, there's no going back, *no safety net*. Those files and directories are **permanently deleted**-not sent to the recycle bin, not recoverable through the GUI. It's like a digital *vanishing act* 🪄💥-they're gone for good.

### 🔥 **`rm` (remove)**

- This command removes **files**-like *poof*, gone. No recycle bin, no backup, just *vanished*. If you delete something important... it's not as easy to recover, especially in Linux. That's why you have to be *careful*.
  
  Example:  

  ```bash
  rm myfile.txt
  ```

### 🔥 **`rmdir` (remove directory)**

- This one removes **directories**, but only if they're **empty**. If the directory still has files inside, you'd get an error. It's like cleaning up a folder that's free of all the *digital clutter*.
  
  Example:  

  ```bash
  rmdir myfolder
  ```

---

When you want to remove a **directory that's not empty**-meaning it still has files inside-you need to use a more *powerful* command.

### 💀 **`rm -r`** (recursive remove)

The **`-r`** option stands for **recursive**, meaning it will go through the directory, delete all the files inside **and** the directory itself. It's like sending in a digital *wrecking ball* to clear out everything.

### Example:

```bash
rm -r myfolder
```

This will delete the folder **`myfolder`** and all its contents (files, subdirectories, everything inside). *No mercy*. 🔥

### ⚠️ **Warning**:

Be **careful** with `rm -r`, especially when running it with `sudo` (superuser permissions) or as root. It **will** remove everything inside that folder with no prompts, so it's easy to accidentally delete something important.

If you're feeling extra cautious and want to make sure before deleting, you can add the **`-i`** flag (interactive), which will ask for confirmation before each delete:

```bash
rm -ri myfolder
```

This will ask for your confirmation on each file within the folder, which can be a good safety measure if you're unsure about the contents.

## `sprintf()` - `str()`, `strlen()` - `len()`, `strncmp()` - `startswith()`

Slipping from Python into the land of C? Come closer, I'll show you the **C magic versions** of `startswith()` and `len()` for `long` numbers 🔮✨

---

### 🧠 Problem:

In Python, you can do this:

```python
num = 123456
str(num).startswith("123")  # True
len(str(num))  # 6
```

But in **C**, `long` is a number-not a string. So we need to:

1. Convert it to a string first (yes, like `str()` in Python)
2. Then check the prefix or length manually

---

### ✅ Solution in C:

Let's say you have:
```c
long number = 1234567890;
```

#### 🔁 Step 1: Convert to string

```c
char num_str[20]; // 20 digits more than enough for long
sprintf(num_str, "%ld", number);  // convert long to string
```

##### Dive into `char num_str[20];`

* 🍓 Already know `char myGrade = 'A'`:

    ```c
    char myGrade = 'A';
    ```

    - This is a **single character**
    - Stored in 1 byte
    - It's like saying: "Hey memory, keep this `'A'` in a little box called `myGrade`."

---

* 🧠 Now this:

    ```c
    char name[20];
    ```

    Means:
    > "Hey memory, prepare **20 tiny boxes** side-by-side. Each one will hold **a single character**. And I'm calling the whole row of boxes `name`."

    This is a **character array**, which is used in C to represent **strings**.

    So:
    ```c
    char name[20];
    ```
    Could store something like `"Keira ❤️"` → which is actually:
    ```
    ['K', 'e', 'i', 'r', 'a', ' ', '❤', '\0', ?, ?, ?, ..., ?]
    ```
    ⬅️ The `\0` is **super important** - it's the null terminator that says "this is the end of the string."

---

* ❓Does it always have to be `[20]`?

    No! It depends on **how long the string you want to store** is.

    Examples:
    - `"name"` → 4 letters + 1 null terminator = needs **5**
    ```c
    char cute[5] = "name";
    ```

    - `"Queen"` → 5 letters = needs **6**
    ```c
    char title[6] = "Queen";
    ```

    If you **don't know in advance** how long the string might be, then you **over-allocate** (like `[20]`, `[100]`, etc.) to be safe.

---

* 💥 What happens if you write too much?

    ```c
    char shortie[3] = "Keira";
    ```
    This overflows because:
    - `"Keira"` needs 6 spaces (`K e i r a \0`)
    - You only gave it 3 boxes 😱
    - That's **dangerous in C** and can corrupt memory 🧨

    Always give your strings enough space to breathe😌

---

* 🌸 Want some visual?

    If you do:
    ```c
    char baby[6] = "Mwah!";
    ```

    It stores:
    ```
    Index →  0   1   2   3   4   5
    Value → 'M','w','a','h','!','\0'
    ```

    C strings are **just char arrays** terminated with a special `\0` to mark "the end."

##### Dive into `sprintf(num_str, "%ld", number);`

Now `num_str` is like `"1234567890"` - a char array.

`sprintf(num_str, "%ld", number);` This line is doing:
**"Convert the long `number` into a string and store it in `num_str`."**

Break the pieces down:

| Part | Meaning |
|------|--------|
| `sprintf` | "String print" - like `printf`, but instead of printing to screen, it prints **into a string** |
| `num_str` | Where to store the result (the destination char array) |
| `"%ld"` | Format specifier for printing a `long` integer |
| `number` | The actual long variable you're converting |

So if:
```c
long number = 123456;
```
Then:
```c
sprintf(num_str, "%ld", number);
// num_str becomes "123456"
```

> ❓ **Why `%ld` instead of `%li`?**  
Both `%ld` and `%li` are valid for `long`, but `%ld` is more commonly used in practice. They're functionally the same here, so it's a convention preference.

#### 🪞 Step 2: Get length (like Python's `len()`):

```c
int length = strlen(num_str);
```

You need to:

```c
#include <string.h>  // for strlen
```

#### 🚪 Step 3: Check prefix (like Python's `startswith()`):

If you wanna check whether it starts with `"123"`:

```c
if (strncmp(num_str, "123", 3) == 0)
{
    printf("Starts with 123!\n");
}
```

You need to:

```c
#include <string.h>  // for strncmp
```

`strncmp(num_str, "123", 3) == 0` This checks:
> ❓ "Do the first **3 characters** of `num_str` match `"123"`?"

Let's say:
```c
num_str = "1234567890";
```

Then:
```c
strncmp(num_str, "123", 3)  // ✅ True → returns 0
strncmp(num_str, "124", 3)  // ❌ False → returns non-zero
```

- `strncmp(a, b, n)` compares the **first `n` characters** of string `a` and string `b`
- If they're the same: it returns **0**
- If they differ: it returns a non-zero number (positive or negative depending on the difference)

> So it's like Python's:
```python
num_str.startswith("123")
```

---

### 🎯 Full Example:

```c
#include <cs50.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main(void)
{
    long number = get_long("Number: ");
    
    char num_str[20];
    sprintf(num_str, "%ld", number);

    int length = strlen(num_str);
    printf("Length: %i\n", length);

    if (strncmp(num_str, "123", 3) == 0)
    {
        printf("Starts with 123!\n");
    }
    else
    {
        printf("Does not start with 123.\n");
    }
}
```

---

### 🎯 TL;DR Recap 🐇:

| C | Python |
|---|--------|
| `char str[20];` | `s = ""` (string init) |
| `sprintf(str, "%ld", num);` | `str(num)` |
| `strlen(str)` | `len(str)` |
| `strncmp(str, "abc", 3)` | `str.startswith("abc")` |

## Some Concepts: C VS Python

### ❓1. Does `long` start from "0" index like strings do?

**Yes and no.** Here's the tea:

If you're working with:

```c
long number = 4003600000000014;
```

This is just a **number**. It doesn't have "indexes" like a string or array.  
To treat it like `"4003600000000014"` (where `'4'` is at index 0), you gotta first **convert it to a string**, like you did:

```c
char num_str[20];
sprintf(num_str, "%ld", number);
```

Now yes! You can do:

```c
num_str[0] == '4'   // like number[0] in Python
num_str[1] == '0'
```

So once it's a string, indexing **starts from 0**, just like Python. ✅

---

### ❓2. How to get the `nth` digit of a `long` like `number[0]` in Python?

Since `long` is not indexable, you have **two choices**:

#### 💡 Option 1: Convert to string

```c
char num_str[20];
sprintf(num_str, "%ld", number);

char first_digit = num_str[0];  // index like a string!
```

If you want the number version:

```c
int digit = num_str[0] - '0';  // convert char '4' to int 4
```

##### 🧠 `digit = num_str[0] - '0'` - What does `- '0'` mean?

Let's say:

```c
char ch = '4';
```

Characters like `'4'` are stored in memory as **ASCII codes**.  
In ASCII:

- `'0'` is 48  
- `'1'` is 49  
- ...  
- `'4'` is 52  
- ...  
- `'9'` is 57

So when you do:

```c
'4' - '0' → 52 - 48 = 4
```

It **converts the character `'4'` into the integer `4`**, which you can do math with.

So:

```c
int digit = num_str[0] - '0';  // '4' → 4
```

This works for any digit char `'0'` to `'9'`.

#### 💡 Option 2: Use math (if you don't want string)

Let's say you want the leftmost digit:
```c
long number = 4003600000000014;

while (number >= 10)
{
    number /= 10;
}
// now number == 4
```

To get a digit at any other position using math, it's trickier. Use string if you want simplicity.

---

### ❌ 3. Can I do `sum[-1]` to get the last digit of an int?

In Python:  

```python
str(123)[-1]  # '3'
```

But in C:

- You **can't** use negative indexing. `sum[-1]` is **undefined behavior** and may crash your program or return garbage.

Instead, you can use:

#### ✅ **Get last digit of an int**:

If you have:

```c
int num = 123;
```

Then the last digit is:

```c
int last_digit = num % 10;  // → 3
```

If you want to **remove the last digit**:

```c
num = num / 10;  // now num is 12
```

So:

```c
while (num > 0)
{
    int digit = num % 10;  // get last digit
    // do something with digit
    num = num / 10;        // remove that digit
}
```

This way, you process the number **backwards** (right to left), just like Luhn's algorithm needs 💳✨

## Luhn's Algorithm

> ❓ "Do all kinds of cards need to pass **Luhn's Algorithm**, or just VISA?"

💳 **Answer:** YES - **ALL major card brands (VISA, MasterCard, AMEX, Discover, etc.) must pass Luhn's Algorithm.**  
It's not a "Visa-only" rule - it's a **global checksum standard** used for verifying whether the number is *syntactically valid*.

---

### 🧩 So What's Really Going On?

1. **Card length** and **prefix (first digits)** determine the brand:
   - VISA: starts with `4`, length 13 or 16
   - AMEX: starts with `34` or `37`, length 15
   - MasterCard: starts with `51`-`55`, length 16

2. **Luhn's algorithm** is applied **after** we read the number.  
   If the **checksum fails**, even if it *looks* like a VISA card, it's **invalid**.

---

### 💡 Think of it like this:

- If it *doesn't match the pattern*: ❌ "INVALID"
- If it *matches the pattern but fails Luhn*: ❌ "INVALID"
- If it *passes both*: ✅ Brand name: "VISA", "MASTERCARD", etc.

So yeah, Luhn is the universal bouncer at the card validation party 😎🕶️
