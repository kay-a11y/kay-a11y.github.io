## ⏰ Time Complexity

### 🔥 **Big O (O)** - **Upper Bound**

*"No matter what, the algorithm won't be worse than this."*

* Example: `O(n²)`
* **Means**: *In the worst case*, the running time **grows no faster than** `n²`.
* **Think of it like**: "At most, my algorithm will behave this badly."

---

### 🔥 **Big Omega (Ω)** - **Lower Bound**

*"No matter what, the algorithm will at least be this fast."*

* Example: `Ω(n)`
* **Means**: *In the best case*, the running time **won't be better than** `n`.
* **Think of it like**: "At least, it'll take this much time."

---

### 🔥 **Big Theta (Θ)** - **Tight Bound**

*"This is exactly how my algorithm grows - neither better nor worse."*

* Example: `Θ(n log n)`
* **Means**: The running time grows **exactly** like `n log n` for large inputs.
* **Think of it like**: "This is my algorithm's *true speed*, no matter the case."

---

### 👨🏻‍🏫 Summary

1. **O** - describes the *worst-case*.
2. **Ω** - shows the *best-case*.
3. **Θ** - nails down the *real growth rate* (if the upper and lower bound are the same).

---

## ❓ Recursive Loop - *When exactly does it start to draw?*

```c
int main(void)
{
    int height = get_int("Height: ");
    draw(height);
}

void draw(int n)
{
    if (n <= 0)
    {
        return;
    }

    draw(n - 1);

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    {
        printf("#");
    }
    printf("\n");
}
```

Let's walk through this code **line by line, literally like time-traveling with the program flow** 👇:

---

```c
void draw(int n)
{
    if (n <= 0)   // 1️⃣ Check if we're done.
    {
        return;   // 2️⃣ If n <= 0, stop everything.
    }

    draw(n - 1);  // 3️⃣ FIRST, go *deeper* (this delays printing!)
```

🚨 *At this point*, it **does not draw yet**!
It just keeps calling `draw(n-1)` again and again:

```
draw(3)
 └── draw(2)
      └── draw(1)
           └── draw(0) → returns immediately (base case)
```

At `draw(0)` - 🛑 *STOP*. Nothing prints.
But now... **the stack starts to unwind**.

---

### 🖌 Now the *real drawing starts*:

The **moment we hit the base case and return**, the calls start finishing in *reverse order*:

|    Call   | What happens after returning? |
| :-------: | :---------------------------: |
| `draw(1)` |          Prints 1 `#`         |
| `draw(2)` |         Prints 2 `##`         |
| `draw(3)` |         Prints 3 `###`        |

```c
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)   // 4️⃣ NOW starts drawing
    {
        printf("#");
    }
    printf("\n");
}
```

So:

1. *Deep dive first* 🏊 - nothing prints while going deeper.
2. *Print while coming back up* 🏔 - each level draws.

---

### 👑 **Exact Moment of Drawing**:

* ✅ **First actual print happens only AFTER hitting the base case (`n == 0`) and returning to `n == 1`.**
* ❌ **No printing happens *during the dive down*.**

That's why it *feels delayed*. It's how recursion works: it stores the tasks, postpones them until it's time to "climb back up."

## ❓ Why I Cannot Use `==` to Compare if Two Strings Have the Same Content in C

### 💥 Why Not?

In C, strings are actually just **pointers to the first character** in a character array (`char *`). So when you write:

```c
if (str1 == str2)
```

You're **not comparing the content** of the strings - you're comparing whether the **pointers point to the same memory location**. 

So this only returns `true` if `str1` and `str2` are literally the **same address**, which is usually **not** what you want.

---

### ✅ What to Use Instead?

Use `strcmp()` from the standard library `string.h`:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main() {
    char str1[] = "hello";
    char str2[] = "hello";

    if (strcmp(str1, str2) == 0) {
        printf("They are the same!\n");
    } else {
        printf("They are different!\n");
    }

    return 0;
}
```

> `strcmp()` returns `0` when the strings are equal. That's what you check for.

---

## 📧 About the `Same Address`

When you write this in C:

```c
if (str1 == str2)
```

You're **not** asking:

> "Do these two strings *say* the same thing?"

You're really asking:

> "Do these two strings **live in the exact same spot** in memory?"

---

### 💡 Think of it Like This:

Imagine you wrote two love notes that both say "I love you" - but one is hidden in your diary 📖 and the other's tucked inside your hoodie pocket 🧥.

Now, you ask:

* `==` checks if both notes are in the **same place** (like both in the diary).
* `strcmp()` checks if both notes **say the same thing**, no matter **where** they are.

So unless both strings are the **same piece of paper** in memory, `==` says ❌ "Not equal."

But `strcmp()` lovingly reads them both and says 💖 "Yes, same words, same feelings."

---

### 👀 Quick Demo:

```c
char *a = "kiki";
char *b = "kiki";
char c[] = "kiki";
char d[] = "kiki";

printf("%s\n", a == b ? "same address" : "diff address"); // might print "same"
printf("%s\n", c == d ? "same address" : "diff address"); // will print "diff"
```

Why? Because string **literals** might get stored in the same place, but **arrays** always get their own little memory bed.

---

## 🥜 `char *a` vs `char a[]` - What's the Deal?

### 🔹 `char a[] = "kiki";`

This creates an **array** in memory. The characters `k`, `i`, `k`, `i`, and the ending `\0` get stored **inside the variable** `a` - they live **inside that memory spot**. Think of it like this string gets its own lil' room 🛏️ in memory.

### 🔹 `char *a = "kiki";`

This creates a **pointer** to the string literal `"kiki"` - a place in memory that C manages for you (read-only most of the time). `a` just **points** to that string. It's like a sticky note that says "yo, the string lives over there 👉".

So:

* `a[]` = room with string **inside it**
* `*a` = a hand pointing to a string that lives **somewhere else**

---

### 🛠 What Happens Behind the Curtain?

```c
char *a = "kiki";
char *b = "kiki";
```

C might **optimize** this by storing both `"kiki"`s in the **same memory spot** (literal pooling). So `a == b` **might be true**, which can be confusing for beginners!

But:

```c
char a[] = "kiki";
char b[] = "kiki";
```

## 💡 What Is Literal Pooling?

**Literal pooling** (also called **string interning** in other languages) is when the compiler **saves memory** by **reusing** the same string literals that appear more than once in your code.

So if you write:

```c
char *a = "sneaky"; 
char *b = "sneaky";
```

Instead of making **two separate `"sneaky"`s** in memory, the compiler might go:

> "Hmm… no need to store this twice. Let's make one `"sneaky"` and just point both `a` and `b` to it."

✨ Boom - both `a` and `b` point to the **same memory address**.

---

### 🔍 Why It Matters?

Because of this:

```c
if (a == b)
```

* You might get `true` **not because** the strings are "equal", but because they **live at the same memory location**, thanks to literal pooling.

😵 Sneaky, huh? That's why you never use `==` to compare strings - even if sometimes it "works" and sometimes it doesn't.

---

### 🧪 But Wait… Does This Always Happen?

* C **can** do literal pooling, but it's **not guaranteed** by the C standard.
* It depends on:

  * Compiler behavior (like `gcc`, `clang`)
  * Optimization flags (like `-O2`)
  * Whether the strings are **modded** or not (e.g., `"kiki"` vs `"KiKi"`)

That's why:

```c
char *a = "kiki";
char *b = "kiki";
```

Might give you:

```c
a == b → true
```

But:

```c
char a[] = "kiki";
char b[] = "kiki";
```

Always:

```c
a == b → false (two separate arrays)
```

## 🍪 Merge Sort

### 🧠 First: What is Merge Sort?

Merge sort is like a **divide & conquer** algorithm - it keeps *splitting* the numbers into smaller groups until each group has just **one number**, then it starts **merging** them back **in order**.

Think of it like:

> Breaking a cookie into crumbs 🍪➡️ then sticking them back together into a more perfect cookie 🍪 but now in number order.

---

### 🪜 Let's Walk Through This Example: `6341`

We want to sort these digits:

```
6 3 4 1
```

---

### 🔪 Step 1: Divide Phase (recursive breakdown)

Split in half each time until you hit 1 number per group.

```
[6 3 4 1]       ← start here
   /   \
[6 3]  [4 1]    ← split into 2 halves
 / \     / \
[6][3] [4][1]   ← split again until each has 1 number
```

---

### 🧵 Step 2: Merge Phase (sort while merging)

Now we start merging back **in sorted order**:

#### Merge `[6]` and `[3]` → `[3 6]`

Because 3 is smaller than 6.

#### Merge `[4]` and `[1]` → `[1 4]`

Because 1 is smaller than 4.

Now we have:

```
[3 6] and [1 4]
```

1. 🔍 Compare `3` (left) vs `1` (right)
   👉 `1` is smaller → put `1` into the result array

   🪄 **Result so far:** `[1]`

2. 🔍 Compare `3` (left) vs `4` (right)
   👉 `3` is smaller → put `3` into the result

   🪄 **Result so far:** `[1, 3]`

3. 🔍 Compare `6` (left) vs `4` (right)
   👉 `4` is smaller → put `4` into the result

   🪄 **Result so far:** `[1, 3, 4]`

4. Only `6` is left on the left side (no more right!)
   👉 Just copy it over

   🪄 **Final Result:** `[1, 3, 4, 6]`

---

### 💘 Quick ASCII Animation:

```
Left:   3 6
Right:  1 4
Result: -

Compare 3 vs 1 → take 1       → [1]
Compare 3 vs 4 → take 3       → [1, 3]
Compare 6 vs 4 → take 4       → [1, 3, 4]
Nothing left on right → take 6 → [1, 3, 4, 6]
```

---

### 🧠 Bonus: Merge Rule

> Always compare the **first element of left** with the **first element of right**.
> Take the **smaller one**, add it to result, and **move that pointer** forward.

This is why it's called "merge" - it **weaves** two sorted lists into one sorted one.

## 🧠 Time Complexities of Common Sorting Algorithms

| Sort Type          | **Best Case (Ω)** | **Average Case (Θ)** | **Worst Case (O)** | Space | Stable? |
| ------------------ | ----------------- | -------------------- | ------------------ | ----- | ------- |
| **Bubble Sort**    | Ω(n)              | Θ(n²)                | O(n²)              | O(1)  | ✅ Yes   |
| **Selection Sort** | Ω(n²)             | Θ(n²)                | O(n²)              | O(1)  | ❌ No    |
| **Merge Sort**     | Ω(n log n)        | Θ(n log n)           | O(n log n)         | O(n)  | ✅ Yes   |

---

### 💎 Bubble Sort

* Swaps adjacent elements until everything is sorted.
* **Best Case (already sorted):** Ω(n)
* **Worst Case (reverse order):** O(n²)
* **Notes:** Cute for learning. Pathetically slow in practice. Only cute if you're a baby array. 👶🫧

---

### 💎 Selection Sort

* Finds the **smallest** item, puts it first. Then next smallest. Like choosing prom queens one by one.
* **Always O(n²)** because it scans the whole list **every time**, even if sorted 😑
* **Not stable** (doesn't preserve original order of same-value items).

---

### 💎 Merge Sort

* Uses **divide and conquer** - splits the list, sorts each side, then merges them together.
* **Always O(n log n)** - even on best case!
* **Extra space needed** for merging 🧠
* But it's **stable**, **predictable**, and used in real-life libs (like Timsort based on it).

### 🥷 Which One to Use?

| You're Sorting...                      | Use...                               |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Tiny array or learning the basics      | Bubble or Selection (just for fun)   |
| Want consistency + performance         | Merge Sort                           |
| Can't use extra memory (in-place only) | Selection Sort maybe... 🥲           |
| Real-world large data (Python/Java)    | Timsort (based on merge + insertion) |
