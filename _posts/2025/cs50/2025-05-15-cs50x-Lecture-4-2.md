## 🎯 WHY does a memory address need 8 bytes (64 bits), while an `int` is only 4 bytes (32 bits)?

### ① Because: It Depends on **Address Space Size**

A memory **address** needs to be *big enough* to point to **any possible location** in your system's **RAM (or virtual memory)**.

* A 32-bit address can point to **2³² = 4,294,967,296** different memory locations → about **4 GB**.
* A 64-bit address can point to **2⁶⁴ = 18,446,744,073,709,551,616** locations → **18 exabytes** of addressable space (yes… that's *exabyte*, like… infinity ✨).

> 👉 So if your CPU uses 64-bit architecture, your pointers must be **64-bit wide**, to be able to **reference any byte** in that massive memory space.
> That's **why pointers are 8 bytes** (64 bits = 8 × 8 bits).

---

### ② So how to "calculate" how big a pointer should be?

Just use this rule of thumb:

```c
sizeof(pointer_type) == sizeof(address_space_of_your_architecture)
```

| Architecture | Max Addressable Memory | Pointer Size |
| ------------ | ---------------------- | ------------ |
| 16-bit       | 2¹⁶ = 64 KB            | 2 bytes      |
| 32-bit       | 2³² = 4 GB             | 4 bytes      |
| 64-bit       | 2⁶⁴ = 18 EB            | 8 bytes      |

So on 64-bit system:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int *p;
    printf("%zu\n", sizeof(p));  // Outputs 8
    return 0;
}
```

Boom 💥 You'll get `8` as output, because `p` stores a 64-bit address!

---

### ③ Meanwhile… `int` is still 4 bytes because:

* You rarely need numbers bigger than 2³² in normal logic (unless you're doing crypto stuff, ect...).

---

### 💬 TL;DR

> `int` stores **a number** → 4 bytes.  
> `pointer` stores **an address** → 8 bytes on a 64-bit machine, because that's how big the road map is 🛣️🧭.

## 🧮 **Unit Conversion: Bits ⇄ Bytes ⇄ KB ⇄ MB ⇄ GB ⇄ TB ⇄ PB ⇄ EB**

| Unit       | How Many Bits? | Notes                                |
| ---------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **1 byte** | 8 bits         | 1B = 8b 🧠                           |
| **1 KB**   | 1024 bytes     | Not 1000 (binary-based)              |
| **1 MB**   | 1024 KB        | = 1,048,576 bytes                    |
| **1 GB**   | 1024 MB        | = 1,073,741,824 bytes                |
| **1 TB**   | 1024 GB        | = 1,099,511,627,776 bytes            |
| **1 PB**   | 1024 TB        | = 1,125,899,906,842,624 bytes        |
| **1 EB**   | 1024 PB        | = 1,152,921,504,606,846,976 bytes 😱 |

> 🧸 Handy formula:

```text
1 byte = 8 bits
1 KB = 1024 bytes = 8,192 bits
1 MB = 1024 × 1024 bytes = 1,048,576 bytes = 8,388,608 bits
1 GB = 1024 × 1024 × 1024 bytes = 1,073,741,824 bytes
```

So if you're ever like:

> "How many bits in 4GB?"

Then the answer is:

```
4 GB = 4 × 1024 × 1024 × 1024 bytes = 4,294,967,296 bytes
→ × 8 = 34,359,738,368 bits 💥
```

---

## 🤯 Q: So my PC has 32GB RAM… that's not even close to 18 EB?!

EXACTLY! 💡

This just uncovered the **difference between physical memory vs. addressable memory space.**

### 🧠 Here's how it works:

* You might have **32 GB physical RAM** installed in your machine.
* But your **CPU can *potentially address* 2⁶⁴ memory locations** (if it's 64-bit) → that's **18 EB** of **virtual memory address space**.

So yes:

> 🔐 Even though most of that space is **unused or unallocated**, the **pointer still needs to be big enough** to *reach* any possible spot in that giant map.

Think of it like this:

* Your house has 5 rooms (32 GB RAM), but the city planner gave you a **street map for all of Tokyo (18 EB space)**-you may not use every block, but you need the full-sized map to *know where to go*.

---

## 🧠 `BYTE b;` - What does it mean?

```c
// Copies a file

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdint.h>

typedef uint8_t BYTE;

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    FILE *src = fopen(argv[1], "rb");
    FILE *dst = fopen(argv[2], "wb");

    BYTE b;

    while (fread(&b, sizeof(b), 1, src) != 0)
    {
        fwrite(&b, sizeof(b), 1, dst);
    }

    fclose(dst);
    fclose(src);
}


```

This line:

```c
typedef uint8_t BYTE;
BYTE b;
```

🟢 First, `typedef uint8_t BYTE;` just means:

> "Let's create a cute nickname `BYTE` for the `uint8_t` type."

And `uint8_t` is from `<stdint.h>` - it's an **unsigned 8-bit integer**, i.e., **a single byte** (0-255 range).

So:

```c
BYTE b;
```

is the same as:

```c
uint8_t b;
```

💡 Meaning: you're declaring a variable `b` that will hold **1 byte at a time**-perfect for copying files **byte-by-byte**.

---

## 💭 Why `!= 0` in the `while (fread(...))` condition?

Here's the line:

```c
while (fread(&b, sizeof(b), 1, src) != 0)
```

### 🔍 What does `fread` do?

```c
fread(pointer_to_buffer, size_of_each_item, number_of_items, file_stream);
```

So here:

* `&b` → where to store the data (pointer to our byte variable)
* `sizeof(b)` → 1 byte (we're reading one byte at a time)
    * the second parameter is in bytes
* `1` → number of items to read
* `src` → source file

It returns: the **number of items successfully read**.

So if it **reads 1 byte successfully**, it returns `1` ✅  
If it **reaches EOF (end of file)** or hits an error, it returns `0` ❌

> 💥 `!= 0` is saying: "Keep reading bytes *as long as fread is returning data*."

#### 🔥 Here's the important truth:

> ✅ The `4` in `fread(buffer, sizeof(BYTE), 4, src)` is **not inherently in "bytes"** - it is the **count of items**, not bytes.  
> But since you're reading 4 items of size 1 byte → you end up reading 4 bytes.

---

## 🎯 `fread(ptr, size, count, stream)` - What's that "count"?

That `count` parameter is:

> 💬 **The number of data *items* (of size `size`) to read from the file stream into memory.**

So in this line:

```c
fread(&b, sizeof(b), 1, src)
```

You're telling C:

> "Hey, read **1 item** that is **`sizeof(b)` = 1 byte** long, and put it into `&b`."

🧠 So here:

* `size = sizeof(b) = 1`
* `count = 1` → means "read *1 unit* of that size" = **1 byte**

Result: reads **1 byte from the file** (not 1 file!)

---

### 🪄 Real-Life Analogy

Imagine:

```c
fread(buffer, 4, 100, src);
```

That means:

> "Read **100 items**, each **4 bytes** long = total **400 bytes** from file `src` into `buffer`."

So:

* You're still reading just **one file**.
* But you're asking: "Give me 100 chunks, each 4 bytes."
* `fread` will return how many chunks it successfully read.

---

### 💡 TL;DR

| Parameter                              | Meaning                        |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `size`                                 | Size of **each item** in bytes |
| `count`                                | How many **items** to read     |
| Total bytes read = `size * count`      |                                |
| Has nothing to do with how many files! |                                |

## 🐍 **chunked or throttled writing** in Python 

### ① `chunk_size` in **downloads**, not just local file writing

Like `requests`:

```python
import requests

url = "https://example.com/bigfile.zip"
with requests.get(url, stream=True) as r:
    with open("bigfile.zip", "wb") as f:
        for chunk in r.iter_content(chunk_size=1024):  # 👈 HERE
            if chunk:  # filter out keep-alive chunks
                f.write(chunk)
```

✨ That `chunk_size=1024` controls how much data gets read in each loop - which directly influences how fast and how often we write to disk.
You can slow it down manually to throttle file writes (e.g., for poor disks or cautious writes).

👉 This means:

> **Read up to 1024 bytes** from the HTTP stream and give them to me as `chunk` each time.

💡 Unit = **bytes**
So:

* `chunk_size=1` → reads 1 byte at a time
* `chunk_size=1024` → reads 1024 bytes = 1 KB at a time
* `chunk_size=1048576` → 1 MB per read

✅ Just like a **buffer size**. We're choosing how *big each bite* of the data is before we swallow it down into the file 🍽️

---

### 🧠 ② Emulating Slow Writing: *Manual Throttling*

You can also control **speed** by combining `.write()` with a time delay:

```python
import time

with open("output.txt", "wb") as f:
    for chunk in chunks:  # assume each chunk is bytes
        f.write(chunk)
        time.sleep(0.1)  # ⏳ delay between writes
```

You can even dynamically adjust that sleep if you're making a tool that mimics **streamed downloads**, **network latency**, or **file corruption tools**.

---

### 💿 ③ Slowing or chunking file saves in **other APIs** (e.g., `shutil`, `aiofiles`)

Python has some wrappers for file copying too:

```python
import shutil

shutil.copyfileobj(src, dst, length=1024)  # 👈 control buffer size with `length`
```

That `length=1024` is like your `chunk_size`, regulating how much data flows at once.

---

## 🧠 Q: In C, Can I `fread(&b, sizeof(b), 4, src)`?

```c
BYTE b;  // just 1 byte of space
fread(&b, sizeof(BYTE), 4, src);  // ❌ you're reading 4 bytes into 1 byte
```

Let's assume:

* `sizeof(b)` = 1 (i.e., `b` is a BYTE = `uint8_t`)
* `4` = count

So this means:

> "Read **4 items**, each **1 byte**, total = **4 bytes** into `&b`"

BUT❗

If `b` is just a **single byte**, you're gonna get undefined behavior 💀 because you're telling C:

> "Read 4 bytes into a memory space only big enough for 1 byte 😵"

---

### ✅ Correct Form to Read 4 Bytes at Once in C:

Must predefine a large enough array. You'd need a **buffer array** like this:

```c
BYTE buffer[4];  // buffer has space for 4 bytes
while (fread(buffer, sizeof(BYTE), 4, src) != 0)
{
    fwrite(buffer, sizeof(BYTE), 4, dst);
}
```

This is safe and beautiful. You're reading:

* 4 items
* each 1 byte
* total 4 bytes
* into a buffer that has room for 4 bytes

🧠 `buffer` is 4 bytes big → perfect match! 

> `buffer` size must be ≥ total bytes you read.

Each loop reads 4 bytes at once → just like `chunk_size=4` in Python.

---

### 😼 TL;DR

* Python's `chunk_size=1024` means **read 1024 bytes per loop** ✅
* In C, to do the same, you'd use `fread(buffer, 1, 1024, src)`

  * But remember to declare: `BYTE buffer[1024];`
* Units are the same in both: **bytes** (not bits, not integers-just raw memory bytes)
* If you mismatch buffer size and read size in C? Boom 💥 undefined behavior.

---

## 🌟Can We Use Smaller or bigger-than-byte Units, Like Bits, Kilobytes, Megabytes?

### 🧠 Can We Use Units Smaller Than a Byte? (Like `BIT`?)

Nope, not directly 😢 - RAM and CPUs only work with **bytes as the minimum addressable unit**.

#### So:

```c
BIT buffer[4];  // ❌ INVALID unless you define BIT yourself as a byte type
```

There's **no built-in `BIT`** in C, because:

* You can't actually *access a single bit* in memory on its own.
* The smallest chunk memory gives you is **1 byte (8 bits)**.

BUT! If you want to simulate bit-by-bit storage, you have options like:

```c
typedef struct {
    unsigned int bit0 : 1;
    unsigned int bit1 : 1;
    unsigned int bit2 : 1;
    unsigned int bit3 : 1;
} Bits4;
```

💡 This uses **bit fields** - but even then, the whole thing is stored in **bytes** under the hood.

---

### ✅ Can We Use Larger Units (KB, MB) in C?

YES! But manually:

There are **no automatic `KB`/`MB` units** in C, but you can create **byte arrays of that size**:

```c
#define KB 1024
#define MB (1024 * KB)

BYTE buffer[KB];   // 1 KB buffer (1024 bytes)
BYTE mega[MB];     // 1 MB buffer (1048576 bytes)
// 👆 You can also name it `BYTE buffer[MB];` if you like
```

You're still working in **bytes**, but now you're defining *named constants* to make code human-readable.

---

#### 😽 Real Examples:

```c
#define KB 1024

typedef uint8_t BYTE;

BYTE buffer[KB];  // 1 kilobyte buffer
fread(buffer, sizeof(BYTE), KB, src);  // read 1KB at once
```

or:

```c
BYTE buffer[512];  // 512 bytes (like a disk sector)
```

---

## 💡 Why do we use `&b` but *not* `&buffer`?

```c
// Copies a file

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdint.h>

typedef uint8_t BYTE;

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    FILE *src = fopen(argv[1], "rb");
    FILE *dst = fopen(argv[2], "wb");

    BYTE b;

    while (fread(&b, sizeof(b), 1, src) != 0)
    {
        fwrite(&b, sizeof(b), 1, dst);
    }

    fclose(dst);
    fclose(src);
}
```

### 📍 Case 1: `BYTE b;` ➤ use `&b`

```c
BYTE b; // Just ONE byte (a value)
fread(&b, sizeof(b), 1, src);
```

> `b` is a **single variable**, not a pointer.  
> To give its **memory address** to `fread`, you must use **`&b`**  
> Because `fread()` needs a pointer - a place to store what it reads.

🧠 You're saying:

> "Here's the address of my 1-byte variable - write into it."

---

### 📦 Case 2: `BYTE buffer[4];` ➤ use `buffer` (not `&buffer`)

```c
BYTE buffer[4]; // An array = already a pointer to first element
fread(buffer, sizeof(BYTE), 4, src);
```

> `buffer` is an **array**, and in C, an array **decays** into a pointer to its **first element**.

So `buffer` is already equivalent to `&buffer[0]` → no `&` needed!

🧠 You're saying:

> "Here's the address of my 4-byte array - you can start writing from here."

---

## Pset - Volume

### 💡 Why does `buffer *= factor` adjust the volume?

> 🎧 WAV audio samples are just numbers.

In `.wav` files:

* The actual audio data (after the 44-byte header) is a sequence of **samples**.
* Each sample is usually stored as a **signed 16-bit integer** = `int16_t`

  * Value ranges from `-32768` to `+32767`
* The louder the sound, the farther the value is from 0.

So:

```c
buffer *= factor;
```

Means:

> 🎚️ "Multiply the current sample's amplitude by some factor (e.g., 0.5 or 2.0)."

* If `factor = 0.5` → volume goes down (quieter)
* If `factor = 2.0` → volume goes up (louder)

✨ You're scaling the wave. Just like stretching or squishing a sound wave on a visualizer.

---

### 🧠 Visualization:

Let's say you read a sample:

```
Original: buffer = 10000
factor = 1.5
buffer = 10000 * 1.5 = 15000
```

It gets louder 🎶
(But warning: too high, and it could overflow beyond 32767 = audio distortion)

---

### Understand `fread` & EOF

✅ If You're Only Reading the Header Once (like this):

```c
fread(header, HEADER_SIZE, 1, input);
fwrite(header, HEADER_SIZE, 1, output);
```

Then **you don't need a loop** or an EOF check.

Why?

> Because you already **know** the header is `44 bytes`.
> And you're just saying: "Read me **exactly 1 block** that's 44 bytes."

🎯 So either:

* It **succeeds** → all good ✅
* Or it **fails** (e.g., input file too small, corrupted) → then `fread()` returns less than 1 (likely 0) ❌

If you wanna be a perfectionist, you can always do:

```c
if (fread(header, HEADER_SIZE, 1, input) != 1)
{
    printf("Failed to read WAV header\n");
    return 1;
}
```

But no EOF loop needed **if you're reading a known number of bytes just once**.

---

### Clamp to 255

#### 1. Use `fminf()` (for `float`, from `<math.h>`)

```c
#include <math.h>

float sepiaRed = fminf(roundf(...), 255.0);
```

💡 This is clean and safe! Just don't forget to `#include <math.h>`

#### 2. Use Ternary Clamp (`? :` conditional operator)

```c
image[i][j].rgbtRed = red > 255 ? 255 : red;
```

💡 Direct and expressive - fast to write, easy to read. Common in C!

## 👣 How to perform a `swap` *directly inside `main`* without using a function?

### ✨ To do this logic:

```c
int x = 1;
int y = 2;
// swap(&x, &y);
```

But **without using `swap()`** as a separate function. Totally doable. But we gotta **avoid touching pointers incorrectly**.

---

#### ❌ This is *not* valid:

```c
int tmp = &x;  // ❌ wrong: &x is a memory address, not an int
&x = &y;       // ❌ double wrong: lvalue of &x can't be assigned
&y = tmp;      // ❌ not assignable
```

That's like trying to assign to someone's home address directly instead of going into the house and changing the contents 🏠

---

### ✅ The correct way to do a `swap` inline in `main` is simple:

```c
int x = 1;
int y = 2;

int tmp = x;
x = y;
y = tmp;
```

That's it!

This is the exact same logic as:

```c
void swap(int *a, int *b)
{
    int tmp = *a;
    *a = *b;
    *b = tmp;
}
```

Just **without the indirection (`*a`, `*b`)** because you're working with the actual variables directly, not through pointers.

---

### 💡 So here's the full thing:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    int x = 1;
    int y = 2;

    printf("x is %i, y is %i\n", x, y);

    // Swap directly here!
    int tmp = x;
    x = y;
    y = tmp;

    printf("x is %i, y is %i\n", x, y);
}
```

---

### 👀 So when do we need pointers?

Only when:

* You're passing variables into a function and want to modify the **originals** (not copies)
* Or you're dealing with arrays, strings, or dynamic memory

In `main`, where `x` and `y` are already **accessible**, you don't need `&` or `*` to swap them.

## Why are all the valid fourth bytes from `0xe0` to `0xef`, and how does that mean the first four bits are `1110`?

![](/assets/img/posts/low_nibble.png)

---

### 🧠 First: What's a Byte in Binary?

Every **hexadecimal number** (like `0xe0`) represents **8 bits** (aka 1 byte).

So:

* `0xe0` = **1110 0000**
* `0xe1` = **1110 0001**
* `0xe2` = **1110 0010**
* ...
* `0xef` = **1110 1111**

Can you see it now? 
All of these share the **first 4 bits**: `1110`

---

### 💡 So what does it mean when we say:

> "The fourth byte's first four bits are `1110`"?

It means:

* The byte is somewhere between `0xe0` and `0xef` (hex range)
* Because all those bytes **start with the binary prefix `1110`**
* The last 4 bits (called the "low nibble") can be anything from `0000` to `1111`

#### In other words:

```c
if ((byte & 0xf0) == 0xe0)  // this checks the upper 4 bits
```

💥 That's how you detect "fourth byte starts with 1110" - it's a **bitmask trick**!

---

### 🧠 What it means - softly and clearly:


```c
buffer[3] & 0xf0
```

We're saying:

> "I only care about the **first 4 bits** (the left ones) - just give me those."

The **last 4 bits** (right ones) will be **ignored**, because we're masking them out.

So for example:

| `buffer[3]` | Binary     | `(buffer[3] & 0xf0)` | Result | Match? |
| ----------- | ---------- | -------------------- | ------ | ------ |
| `0xe0`      | `11100000` | `11100000`           | `0xe0` | ✅      |
| `0xe1`      | `11100001` | `11100000`           | `0xe0` | ✅      |
| `0xef`      | `11101111` | `11100000`           | `0xe0` | ✅      |
| `0xea`      | `11101010` | `11100000`           | `0xe0` | ✅      |
| `0xd8`      | `11011000` | `11010000`           | `0xd0` | ❌      |

> **This `== 0xe0` condition only checks the first 4 bits!**  
> It says: "Is this byte part of the `0xe0` to `0xef` range?"

---

### 💬 Does it ignore the last 4 bits?

✅ **YES.** The last 4 bits can be:

* `0000` = `0x0`
* `0001` = `0x1`
* ...
* `1111` = `0xf`

And ALL of them will still satisfy `(buffer[3] & 0xf0) == 0xe0`.

You're only comparing the **upper nibble** - the "high 4 bits".

---

### 🔍 Why do JPEGs have this pattern?

Because it's part of the **JFIF standard**, where image segments (like headers, metadata, compressed data, etc.) start with **marker bytes**.

* JPEG **start-of-image** (SOI) marker: `0xFF 0xD8`
* Followed by a **marker segment**, usually starting with `0xFF` again, then **one of those `0xE0`-`0xEF`** codes

That's how JPEG decoders know:

> "Yep, this is a valid segment of a JPEG file!"

## Pset Recovery

### 💡 Why do we "add blocks to the current JPEG"?

It's because **a JPEG file is way bigger than 512 bytes**.

Let's say one photo is 1MB.
That means:

> `1MB = 1024 * 1024 = 1,048,576 bytes`
> So... that photo takes up **1,048,576 ÷ 512 = 2048 blocks** on the memory card!

So when we're recovering it, we don't just copy the first block - we need to copy **all 2048 of those 512-byte blocks** into a single `.jpg` file 💡

#### 🧃 Imagine this:

##### 📸 One photo = many 512-byte pieces

* 📦 Block 0: JPEG start
* 📦 Block 1: more photo data
* 📦 Block 2: even more photo data
* ...
* 📦 Block 2047: last part of the photo

You want to **copy all these blocks** into **one JPEG file** on your computer.

That's what we mean by:

> "Adding blocks to the current JPEG"

### 🧠 So let's say:

> **"A JPEG starts with a 512-byte block that has a signature."**  
> BUT - **the JPEG continues into more blocks after that.**  
> And we don't know exactly how many blocks it takes.

So what do we do?

---

#### 💡 Answer: We keep writing **every block** to the same file...

...until we find the **start of the next JPEG**.

---

#### 💾 Imagine this structure on the memory card:

```
Block 0 → JPEG #1 start (0xff 0xd8 0xff ...)
Block 1 → continuation of JPEG #1
Block 2 → continuation of JPEG #1
Block 3 → start of JPEG #2! (new signature)
Block 4 → continuation of JPEG #2
Block 5 → continuation...
Block 6 → JPEG #3 start
...
```

#### Your job as the JPEG-saver:

* 👀 See block 0? It's a JPEG start → open `000.jpg` and start writing
* 👀 Block 1? No signature → keep writing into `000.jpg`
* 👀 Block 2? No signature → still writing...
* 👀 Block 3? New JPEG start! → close `000.jpg`, open `001.jpg`, start writing
* Repeat 🌀
