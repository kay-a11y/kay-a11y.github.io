So here's the deal.  
I'm still pretty fresh to Raspberry Pi and all that terminal kung fu, but I made the damn thing **my personal digital sniper**, silently blocking ads, hijacking DNS, and routing all my traffic through encrypted tunnels like a stealthy lil fox in black hoodie mode.

> No more phucking ISP tracking.  
> No more random DNS leaks.  
> No more lame wired setups or HDMI tethering like it's 2009.

I'm not even gonna dignify that rotten excuse of a firewall with a name. Starts with G, ends in get the PHUCK outta my packets. üñï  
We're playin' nice here - for the blog. But you know. You know.

---

This blog is for my fellow rebels who wanna:

* üìñ **Actually understand** how DNS works and why it's not just some invisible ghost
* üõ†Ô∏è Make **Pi-hole** and **Clash.Meta CLI** run side-by-side like baddies with knives
* üö´ Keep ad-blocking strong on **DIRECT traffic**, even when things get tangled with proxies
* üîå SSH into the Pi **wirelessly**, like a damn boss-no HDMI, no cables, no mess
* üß† Build a setup that **routes traffic smart**, not blindly through your PHREAKIN' ISP
* üîí **Avoid DNS leaks** like the plague and keep your data where it belongs **with you**

Once you taste this kind of setup freedom, you'll never wanna go back to vanilla internet.

## üö† Enable SSH

This would suppose you already finished installation of your Pi OS.  
First things first, before we start, make sure you enable the SSH service on your pi.

### 1. **Make sure SSH is installed and running on the Pi**

Now only this would need a HDMI to check, so boot Pi into GUI, let's do a double check:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable ssh
sudo systemctl start ssh
sudo systemctl status ssh
```

> You wanna see: `active (running)` in green.  
> If it says *not found*, just do:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install openssh-server
```

---

### 2. **Get your Pi's IP address**

```bash
ip a
```

You'll get like `<PI_IP>`.

But to double-check:

```bash
hostname -I
```

---

### 3. **SSH from your Main PC**

Now you could get HDMI outta of your so darn sexy monitor. From your PC terminal:

```bash
ssh <USERNAME>@<PI_IP>
```

First time? Say yes to the fingerprint.  
Then you're in - your Pi, remotely seduced.

---

### 4. **Configure static IP on Pi**

If you don't wanna touch the router:

Edit your Pi's DHCP config:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/dhcpcd.conf
```

Scroll down and add:

```ini
interface wlan0
static ip_address=<PI_IP>/24
static routers=<Router_IP>
static domain_name_servers=1.1.1.1 8.8.8.8
```

Save it (Ctrl+O, Enter, Ctrl+X), then:

```bash
sudo reboot
```

---

## üçç install Pi-hole

### üõ†Ô∏è Step-by-step: Install Pi-hole

**Run this one-liner install command (curl version):**

```bash
curl -sSL https://install.pi-hole.net | bash
```

This will launch a guided terminal installer that will ask you:

---

### üí° What you'll be asked (and what to pick)

1. **Static IP**  
   ‚úîÔ∏è click `<Continue>`

2. **Choose an interface**  
   üõú Hit `space` to select `<whlan0>` whatever your wireless interface is - since we're going fully wireless with the Pi.  
   ‚ùå Make sure `eth0` is unselected (just one should be checked)

3. **DNS provider**  
   üïò Start with Quad9 (filtered, DNSSEC).

4. **Blocklists**  
   ‚úîÔ∏è Use the default ones - you can add more later.

5. **Web admin interface?**  
   ‚úîÔ∏è YES, you want this

6. **Web server (lighttpd)?**  
   ‚úîÔ∏è YES - unless you already plan to use Nginx

7. **Log queries?**  
   ‚úîÔ∏è YES - it's fun seeing what gets blocked

8. **Select a privacy mode for FTL**  
    0Ô∏è‚É£ Stick with `0 - Show everything` - Logs ALL domain requests + which client made them

---

### ‚úÖ When it finishes

It'll give you a cute little message like:

> Web Interface: [http://<PI_IP>/admin](http://<PI_IP>/admin)
> Password: [your randomly generated web password]

Save that password or run:

```bash
pihole -a -p
```

to change it.

---

### Now access it

Open a browser and go to:

```
http://<PI_IP>/admin
```

Login, poke around!

#### Recommend Blocklist

In `Lists` -> `Address:` -> `Add blocklist`

You can add these URL **one by one**.

```txt
https://adaway.org/hosts.txt
https://big.oisd.nl/
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/StevenBlack/hosts/master/hosts
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PolishFiltersTeam/KADhosts/master/KADhosts.txt
https://urlhaus.abuse.ch/downloads/hostfile/
https://pgl.yoyo.org/adservers/serverlist.php?hostformat=hosts&showintro=1&mimetype=plaintext
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Isaaker/Spotify-AdsList/main/Lists/pi-hole.txt
```

then

```bash
sudo pihole -g
```

or `Tools` -> `Update Gravity` -> `Update`

---

## üì± Set your Phone/router's dns

### ‚úÖ Set DNS manually in phone Wi-Fi settings

Go to your phone's **Wi-Fi > Network details > IP settings** ‚Üí switch to **Static** or **Manual** and set:

* **DNS1**: `<PI_IP>` (your Pi-hole)
* **DNS2**: `<PI_IP>`

üß† Pro Tip: Don't forget to **forget the network first**, then reconnect with new DNS.

---

## üí° run a VPN on your Pi while still using Pi-hole as DNS

### üí¨ TL;DR first

> You can run a **VPN (like Clash / V2Ray)** on your Pi while still using **Pi-hole as DNS** for all your devices, so:

* You block ads + trackers
* You **don't need to run VPN on every device**

---

### ‚úÖ Part 1: Confirmed - Pi-hole works perfectly **without VPN**

Try to connect some site already blocked by pi-hole via your phone/pc. If that works, that's great.

Which means your DNS chain looks like this:

```
[Device] --> [Pi-hole @ <PI_IP>] --> [Quad9 or other upstream]  
```

---

### ‚úÖ Part 2: Why VPN breaks Pi-hole blocking

When you **run VPN** on your device, one of two things happens:

| Situation                                           | Result                                      |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| VPN forces DNS over its own server                  | Pi-hole is bypassed entirely              |
| VPN sends all traffic (incl DNS) through its tunnel | Local ISP is bypassed, but ad blocking is gone |

So you're either *free* but *unprotected*, or *blocked* but *adless*.
That sucks. We want **BOTH**.

---

### üî• Part 3: THE MASTERPLAN

> **Use the Pi as a centralized VPN router** that:

* Runs **Clash**
* Routes all *international* traffic through the VPN
* Keeps **DNS local** so Pi-hole still blocks stuff
* Protects *all* devices in your network **without installing VPN apps on them**

```
[All Devices]
      ‚Üì (DNS: <PI_IP>)
    [Router]
      ‚Üì
    [Raspberry Pi]
    ‚îú‚îÄ Pi-hole ‚Üí handles DNS (blocks ads)
    ‚îî‚îÄ Clash ‚Üí handles traffic routing
         ‚Ü≥ sites in rule ‚Üí VPN
         ‚Ü≥ Local stuff ‚Üí direct
```

---

#### üõ† Set It Up

#### ‚úÖ Install Clash on the Pi

Go to `https://github.com/MetaCubeX/mihomo/releases` download a latest release

e.g. :

```bash
# Download the binary, and don't forget to check out the latest release yourself!
wget https://github.com/MetaCubeX/mihomo/releases/download/Prerelease-Alpha/mihomo-linux-arm64-alpha-34de62d.gz

# Unpack it
gunzip mihomo-linux-arm64-alpha-34de62d.gz

# Rename it for convenience
mv mihomo-linux-arm64-alpha-34de62d clash

# Make it executable
chmod +x clash

# Move it into place
sudo mv clash /usr/local/bin
```

Now try:

```bash
clash -v
```

You should see something like:

```scss
Clash.Meta (mihomo) vX.XX...
```

#### üìÅ Add your node/subscription file

Drop in your config here:

```bash
sudo nano /root/.config/mihomo/config.yaml
```

Paste in your config or YAML from your GUI-exported setup.  

Or copy the config into your Pi from your PC:

On PC:

```bash
scp <yaml_path> raspberrypi@<PI_IP>:~/config-temp.yaml

```

SHH into Pi, then move with sudo:

```bash
sudo mv ~/config-temp.yaml /root/.config/mihomo/config.yaml
```

---

#### DNS Config

```yaml
mixed-port: 7890
redir-port: 7892
tproxy-port: 7893
allow-lan: true
bind-address: '*'
mode: rule
log-level: info

external-controller: '0.0.0.0:9090'
secret: "<your_password>"

dns:
  enable: true
  ipv6: false
  listen: '127.0.0.1:7875'
  default-nameserver:
    - 1.1.1.1
    - 8.8.8.8
  enhanced-mode: redir-host
  use-hosts: true
  respect-rules: true
  nameserver:
    - 127.0.0.1:53
  proxy-server-nameserver:
    - https://1.1.1.1/dns-query
  fallback:
    - https://cloudflare-dns.com/dns-query
  fallback-filter:
    geoip: true
    geoip-code: "<your_country_code>"
    geosite:
      - "<your_region_blocklist_or_category>"
```

> Feel free to change `<your_password>`.

> Restart to reload after editing the config file: `sudo systemctl restart mihomo`, then `SSH` to Pi again.

### Run clash and select your node

Now ran

```bash
clash
```

---

#### ‚úÖ **Pick your node**

1. **List groups**:

   ```bash
   curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer <your_password>" http://127.0.0.1:9090/proxies | jq '.proxies | keys'
   ```

2. **Check what's inside `<Node Provider>`**:

   ```bash
   curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer <your_password>" http://127.0.0.1:9090/proxies/<node_provider> | jq '.all'
   ```

3. **Switch to whatever node you want**, like:

   ```bash
   curl -X PUT -H "Authorization: Bearer <your_password>" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"name": "<node_name>"}' \
    http://127.0.0.1:9090/proxies/<node_provider>
   ```

   > Feel free to change `<your_password>`, `<node_provider>` and `<node_name>` to your own values.

---

#### ‚úÖ **Verify it worked**

```bash
curl --proxy http://127.0.0.1:7890 https://api.myip.com
```

If it says your proxy IP - then yes, you're surfing the free web.

---

### ‚úÖ **Make Clash/Mihomo run in the background (so terminal can close)** - Use `systemd` for full background service

Let's make Mihomo auto-start on boot like a real daemon

1. Create a systemd service:

   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/mihomo.service
   ```

   Paste:

   ```ini
   [Unit]
   Description=Mihomo Service
   After=network.target

   [Service]
   ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/clash -f /root/.config/mihomo/config.yaml
   Restart=on-failure
   User=root

   [Install]
   WantedBy=multi-user.target
   ```

2. Enable & start it:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl daemon-reexec
   sudo systemctl enable mihomo
   sudo systemctl start mihomo
   ```

3. Check status:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl status mihomo
   ```

### IP forwarding & iptables Setup

#### 1. Enable IP forwarding on your Pi

  ```bash
  echo 1 | sudo tee /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
  sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
  ```

  Make it permanent by editing:

  ```bash
  sudo nano /etc/sysctl.conf
  ```

  Uncomment or add:

  ```
  net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1
  ```

---

### 2. Setup iptables rules

Redirect traffic from other devices to Clash. Transparent proxy for LAN (redir+TPROXY).

Assume your Pi's LAN NIC is `eth0` and LAN = `192.168.100.0/24`. This:

* Captures **TCP** to `redir-port 7892`
* Captures **UDP (QUIC/DNS/‚Ä¶ )** to `tproxy-port 7893`
* Excludes local/LAN/broadcast/SSH

```bash
LAN_IF=wlan # edit this
LAN_CIDR=192.168.100.0/24 # edit this
CLASH_TCP=7892
CLASH_TP=7893

# ----- TCP (REDIR) -----
sudo iptables -t nat -N CLASH || true
sudo iptables -t nat -F CLASH

# bypass LAN, router, and the Pi itself
sudo iptables -t nat -A CLASH -d 192.168.0.0/16 -j RETURN
sudo iptables -t nat -A CLASH -d 10.0.0.0/8     -j RETURN
sudo iptables -t nat -A CLASH -d 172.16.0.0/12  -j RETURN
sudo iptables -t nat -A CLASH -d 224.0.0.0/4    -j RETURN
sudo iptables -t nat -A CLASH -d 255.255.255.255 -j RETURN
sudo iptables -t nat -A CLASH -d 127.0.0.0/8    -j RETURN
sudo iptables -t nat -A CLASH -d $(hostname -I | awk '{print $1}') -j RETURN

# redirect TCP to Clash redir
sudo iptables -t nat -A CLASH -p tcp -j REDIRECT --to-ports $CLASH_TCP

# hook PREROUTING for LAN ingress
sudo iptables -t nat -D PREROUTING -i $LAN_IF -j CLASH 2>/dev/null || true
sudo iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i $LAN_IF -j CLASH

# ----- UDP (TPROXY) -----
sudo ip rule add fwmark 1 lookup 100 2>/dev/null || true
sudo ip route add local 0.0.0.0/0 dev lo table 100 2>/dev/null || true

sudo iptables -t mangle -N CLASH_UDP || true
sudo iptables -t mangle -F CLASH_UDP

# bypass LAN, router, multicast, loopback
sudo iptables -t mangle -A CLASH_UDP -d 192.168.0.0/16 -j RETURN
sudo iptables -t mangle -A CLASH_UDP -d 10.0.0.0/8     -j RETURN
sudo iptables -t mangle -A CLASH_UDP -d 172.16.0.0/12  -j RETURN
sudo iptables -t mangle -A CLASH_UDP -d 224.0.0.0/4    -j RETURN
sudo iptables -t mangle -A CLASH_UDP -d 255.255.255.255 -j RETURN
sudo iptables -t mangle -A CLASH_UDP -d 127.0.0.0/8    -j RETURN

# send UDP into Clash TPROXY
sudo iptables -t mangle -A CLASH_UDP -p udp -j TPROXY --on-port $CLASH_TP --tproxy-mark 0x1/0x1

# mark packets so the ip rule picks them up
sudo iptables -t mangle -D PREROUTING -i $LAN_IF -p udp -j CLASH_UDP 2>/dev/null || true
sudo iptables -t mangle -A PREROUTING -i $LAN_IF -p udp -j CLASH_UDP
```

Exclude port 22 from redirection, keep SSH and LAN safe:

```bash
sudo iptables -t nat -I CLASH -p tcp --dport 22 -j RETURN
```

### 3. Make It Stick (Persistence Setup)

Install persistent rules:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install iptables-persistent
```

Say **yes** when it asks to save your current rules.

### 4. Save your working rules to disk

```bash
sudo iptables-save | sudo tee /etc/iptables/rules.v4
```

Check them again with:

```bash
sudo cat /etc/iptables/rules.v4
```

---

### Final: Set Raspberry Pi as **default gateway** for phone

On phone's Wi-Fi settings:

1. Choose your current network
2. Edit **IP Settings** ‚Üí set to **Static**
3. Then set:

   | Field      | Value                                                   |
   | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
   | IP Address | Same as your phone already has (e.g. `192.168.1.200`) |
   | Gateway    | `<PI_IP>` ‚Üê your Pi                             |
   | DNS        | `<PI_IP>` ‚Üê your Pi-hole                        |

4. Save and reconnect

---

#### test

```bash
curl https://api.myip.com
```

From your phone (or go to [ipinfo.io](https://ipinfo.io)), should see your **proxy IP**, NOT your local ISP.

---

#### Switch Pihole upstream

Now the node's ready, we can change Pi-hole DNS upstream to Clash.

Make `/etc/resolv.conf` always point to Pi-hole.

```bash
sudo rm /etc/resolv.conf
echo "nameserver 127.0.0.1" | sudo tee /etc/resolv.conf
sudo chattr +i /etc/resolv.conf # unchangable
# use `sudo chattr -i /etc/resolv.conf` to make it changable
```

In `Settings` -> `DNS` -> `Custom DNS servers`, type this only:

```txt
127.0.0.1#7875
```

Then reload Pi-hole DNS:

```bash
sudo pihole reloaddns
```

Now Pi-hole upstream always point to `127.0.0.1#7875` (mihomo)

---

## What DNS Really Does

DNS = Domain Name System
It's like the **phonebook of the internet**-turning names like `spotify.com` into IP addresses like `35.186.224.25` so your device knows where to connect.

So When You Use Pi-hole as DNS, **Pi-hole becomes the phonebook**. Anyone using your Pi-hole to resolve DNS (like your Phone) is asking **your Pi-hole**:

  > "Yo, what's the IP of `doubleclick.net`?"

And your Pi-hole can:

* Block domains you blacklist
* Log every domain someone asks
* Forward to upstream DNS if needed

---

### What's a DNS Leak

> Check [BrowserLeaks](https://browserleaks.com/dns) or [DnsLeakTest](https://www.dnsleaktest.com/) to see if you're experiencing a DNS leak.

A **DNS leak** happens when:

* Your device is **supposed** to use your DNS server (like your Pi-hole)
* But instead, it **sends DNS queries elsewhere**, usually:

  * Your ISP
  * Google (8.8.8.8 or `74.x.x.x`)
  * Some weird encrypted DNS behind your back (DoH/DoT)

This **leaks your browsing activity**, even if you're on a VPN or using a filter like Pi-hole.

---

## OSI Model Breakdown

### **Layer 3 - Network Layer**

* This is where **IP routing** lives.
* When you **change the gateway** to your Pi, you're **redirecting packets** to go through your VPN tunnel on the Pi.
* That means: You're redirecting traffic away from your ISP before it ever reaches them.

> **Result**: Your traffic doesn't even touch the phucking local ISP. Pi hijacks it, puts it into the VPN, and tunnels it safely.

### **Layer 7 - Application Layer**

* DNS lives up here (yes, even though it *feels* low-level).
* Your Pi-hole acts here: **intercepts DNS queries** and either resolves or blocks them.
* Ads blocked? Domains rewritten? That's Layer 7 magic.

> Combined with Layer 7 control (DNS, ad-block, tracking protection), it's like you built your own damn **freedom stack**

| Layer | Action                                                             |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 3     | **Redirected TCP/IP traffic** to your VPN tunnel on Pi             |
| 7     | **Intercepted DNS queries** and blocked/sanitized them via Pi-hole |

---

Now they'll load on **every reboot**, even if you're sleepy and forget.

> **If DNS breaks, ads return, or VPN feels flaky:**
>
> * Restart `mihomo` & Pi-hole
> * Check `/etc/resolv.conf`
> * Clear device DNS cache
> * Or just... turn it off and back on
> * Maybe you'd like to check this [Troubleshooting](https://kay-a11y.github.io/posts/troubleshoot-clash-port/) out?

## Command Cheatsheet

* mihomo & Pi-hole

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl start mihomo
   sudo systemctl status mihomo
   sudo systemctl stop mihomo
   sudo pkill -9 clash 2>/dev/null || true

   # port checking  
   sudo ss -ltnup | egrep '(:53|:7875|:7890|:9090)'

   # Pi-hole
   sudo pihole reloaddns

   # if on node
   curl -s https://ipinfo.io
   curl -x 127.0.0.1:7890 https://ipinfo.io
   ```

* Reload Clash config:

   ```bash
   sudo curl -X PATCH \
   -H "Authorization: Bearer <your_password>" \
   -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
   --data '{"path":"/root/.config/mihomo/config.yaml","force":true}' \
   http://127.0.0.1:9090/configs
   ```

* Grammar Check:

   ```bash
   cd /tmp
   cp /root/.config/mihomo/config.yaml .
   /usr/local/bin/clash -f ./config.yaml -t
   ```
