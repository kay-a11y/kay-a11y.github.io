## A Real Story

Somehow, I was feeling nostalgic.
Remember back then… when I was only *12 years old*?
My home didn't have fancy mobile phones, or private wireless base stations.

*We had just one home phone line that connected to several handsets-one downstairs, one upstairs.*

In that cozy two-story house, I used to sneak onto the second-floor phone like a curious little kitten.

Whenever my father picked up the old-school phone downstairs, and I picked up the one upstairs, **I could hear him talking**.
(Whether I could hear both sides of the conversation or just my father, I honestly can't remember now-most of the details are fuzzy.
I just remember **the magic of listening quietly without them knowing, as long as I picked up the phone at the same time they did**.)

**It felt like pure magic.**
And even now, I still don't fully know how it worked.

So today… *I'm going to pull back the curtain and reveal the secrets under the hood* -
*with some delicious phreaking history and old-school hacker stories along the way.* 🚀📞✨

## 🔌 How Old Phones (Landlines) Actually Worked Inside Your House

Imagine back when you were a little girl/boy, sitting upstairs in your house. 🏡
You picked up the old-style phone while your father was already on a call downstairs.

**But WHY could you "join" the call quietly?**  
Because all the phones inside your house were **wired together** into *one simple electric loop.* 🎈

Here's the magic behind it:

### 🛜 Step-by-Step Inside the Old Phone System (Plain Old Telephone Service - POTS):

1. **Shared Loop:**  
   Your house had **one copper wire pair** coming in from the outside telephone network.  
   - It carried **both** the ability to ring the phones **and** carry voice conversations.
   - Every phone inside the house **tapped** into that same wire. 📞➰📞

2. **Idle State:**  
   - When nobody picked up, the phone line stayed at about **48 volts of DC electricity**. 🔋
   - The phones just "listened" - no active voice signals yet.

3. **Pick Up = Close the Circuit:**  
   - When you (or your father) **picked up** the phone handset,
   - it **closed an electric circuit** inside the phone.
   - This "loop closure" told the telephone exchange outside:  
     👉 *"Hello! Someone wants to make or receive a call!"*

4. **Ongoing Call = Active Circuit:**  
   - Once connected, your voices were **converted into tiny electrical signals** 🧠⚡
   - These signals **rode the same wire** to the telephone company's switching center, and to the person on the other end of the call.

5. **Sneaky Pick-Up:**  
   - Because **all phones at your house shared the same loop**,  
   - If you picked up another phone during a call,  
   - *your handset got connected to the same ongoing electrical conversation!*

6. **No Notification:**  
   - The system was too simple to detect "Hey, a second phone picked up!"  
   - There were no smart processors yet - so you could listen without anyone knowing. 👻

## 🌟 Tiny Visual Story (Imagine This)

```
[Outside World] ---(wire)---> [House Main Line] --+--> [Father's Phone] (picked up)
                                                 |
                                                 +--> [Your Phone] (picked up silently)
```

Both phones **share the exact same conversation path**, like two straws stuck into one soda! 🥤➰🥤

## 📞✨ Q: Why Idle Voltage is 48V in POTS

First, even when **no one is calling**, even when the phone **just sits there**,  
there's **48 volts DC** sitting on the line.

But **why 48V**, specifically?

Here's the inside story:

---

### 📚 Reasons for 48V:

1. **Signal Readiness:**  
   The telephone exchange (the big switching machine downtown) needs a way to know whether a phone is "alive" (on hook) or "wants to talk" (off hook).  
   - 48V gives enough electrical "presence" for detection.
   
2. **Powering the Phone Itself:**  
   Old landline phones didn't plug into wall power. ⚡  
   - They **pulled power from the phone line** itself!
   - (That's why during blackouts, your wired phone still worked - magical, huh? 🧙‍♂️)

3. **Protection from Noise:**  
   Higher voltage helps overcome little bits of electrical noise or leaks in the line (countryside wires could be messy!).

4. **Safety First:**  
   48V is **high enough** to be functional but **low enough** to not kill you if you touch it accidentally.  
   - *(Though it can give a nasty zap!)*  
   - It's below dangerous shock levels under most conditions.

**Fun Fact:**  
Actually, it's often **-48V** (negative voltage), not positive - because using negative prevents corrosion on the copper wires. ⚡➖

### ⚡🛜 So, YES:

Even when idle,  
**your POTS line is sitting there quietly sipping electricity**.  
Not much, but always alive... like a cat half-sleeping but still listening. 🐈‍⬛✨

---

### 🧮✨ How much electricity does it consume?

Now let's get nerdy and cute, okay?

**Let's calculate an estimate:**

---

#### Step 1 - Normal Idle Current

When the phone is idle (on-hook), almost **no current** flows.  
The **circuit is open**, meaning the electricity is "waiting" but not really "moving."

- The line is sitting there with 48V applied,
- But the **current flow** is tiny - basically in microamps (µA) range.

**Typical idle current:**  
🔹 **Around 2 to 20 microamps** (depending on line condition).

---

#### Step 2 - Power = Voltage × Current

Let's take the middle estimate:
- 48V × 10µA (microamps) = **0.00048 Watts**

(Yes, **less than half a thousandth of a watt!** 😱💡)

---

#### Step 3 - Energy in a Day

Energy (watt-hours) = Power (watts) × Time (hours)

- 0.00048W × 24h = **0.01152 watt-hours per day**

That's **basically nothing**.

---

### 🧡 In Short:

| Item | Estimate |
|:----|:---------|
| Idle voltage | -48V |
| Idle current | ~10 microamps |
| Daily energy usage | ~0.012 Wh |
| Daily electricity cost | Way less than 1 cent! |

You could leave that line connected for 10 years and barely notice anything on your electricity bill. 😹💡

---

### 🛡️💬 So Conclusion:

- Yes, POTS always "consumes" tiny electricity when idle.  
- But it's *incredibly tiny* - **like a single breath of wind pushing a leaf** 🍃.
- In that countryside house? Probably **so little the electric meter doesn't even blink.**
