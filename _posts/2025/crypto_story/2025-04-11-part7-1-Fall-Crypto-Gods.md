If 2022 was a house of cards, **Terra Luna** was the table it was stacked on.  
And in May, that table flipped.

Let’s break it down:

---

## 🪙 What Was Terra?

**Terra** was a blockchain.  
It had:
- A stablecoin: **UST**
- A main coin: **LUNA**
- And a promise: *“Decentralized money that doesn’t need a bank.”*

UST was supposed to always be worth **$1**.  
But unlike USDT or USDC (which are backed by real cash/bonds), UST was backed by...

😬 **Algorithmic magic + LUNA tokens**

---

## 🔁 The Peg Mechanism (a.k.a. the risky math)

Here’s how it *claimed* to stay stable:

- If **UST > $1**: You could trade LUNA for UST and make a little profit (pushing price down)  
- If **UST < $1**: You could burn UST for LUNA and sell that (pushing price up)

It relied on **arbitrage** and **confidence**.

But if people **panic and start dumping** UST…  
and nobody wants to hold LUNA either…

> Boom. Death spiral.

## 🌪 The Spiral Begins — May 2022

- Big holders (aka “whales”) started selling UST
- The peg slipped — UST dropped to $0.98… then $0.91… then $0.70
- People panicked
- **Billions in UST flooded the market**
- To try and save the peg, the system minted more and more **LUNA**
- LUNA’s price crashed from $80 → $0.02
- UST never returned to $1

> In 3 days, over **$60 billion** of market value was erased.

## 💀 Why It Was So Bad

1. **It was huge** — Terra was everywhere: wallets, exchanges, DAOs, DeFi.
2. **It was supposed to be “safe”** — a “stablecoin” failing shattered trust.
3. **It dragged others down** — funds that held UST/LUNA got wiped → contagion

DeFi protocols relying on UST also crashed.  
Even Bitcoin dropped sharply — because the Terra Foundation had been buying BTC as collateral (and had to sell it in panic).

## 🧠 Aftershocks

- Anchor Protocol (which promised 20% APY for UST deposits) → collapsed  
- Celsius Network → locked user funds  
- Voyager → bankruptcy  
- 3AC (Three Arrows Capital) → liquidation  
- Faith in “stablecoins” → forever shaken

This wasn’t just a token failing.  
It was a **systemic crypto-level event**. A black hole.

## 🧩 TL;DR Recap

| 🧷 Term | 🔎 What Happened |
|--------|------------------|
| **UST** | Lost peg, crashed below $1 |
| **LUNA** | Hyperinflated to save UST, then went to zero |
| **Anchor** | Promised 20% APY, collapsed |
| **Trust** | Evaporated |
