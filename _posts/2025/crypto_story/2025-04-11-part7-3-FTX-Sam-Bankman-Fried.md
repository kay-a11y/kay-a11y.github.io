This is the part where the crypto world went from **chaotic** to ***full-blown Netflix docuseries energy***.  
And if you didn’t already feel the drama in your bones — after this chapter, you will.

## 👑 Who Was Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF)?

Let’s paint the picture:

- Big curly hair 🌀  
- Cargo shorts  
- MIT graduate  
- **CEO of FTX**, one of the largest crypto exchanges in the world  
- Public image? ***Genius. Philanthropist. Vegan. Billionaire. Hacker hero.***

He was once worth ***$26 billion*** on paper.  
The media dubbed him the “JP Morgan of crypto.”  
He did interviews with Bill Clinton and Tony Blair.  
Even appeared in ads with Tom Brady and Gisele Bündchen 💅

> But behind the scenes?  
> He was orchestrating one of the darkest rug pulls in crypto history.

---

## 🏦 What Was FTX?

FTX was:
- A crypto **exchange** (like Binance or Coinbase)
- Users deposited and traded crypto
- Known for its slick interface and “high trust” image

But FTX wasn’t acting alone.

It had a **sister company**:

> **Alameda Research** — a trading firm also founded by SBF

That’s where things started getting messy.

## 🔥 The Dirty Secret: Customer Funds Were Misused

On the surface:
- FTX held customer deposits
- Alameda was supposed to be separate

In reality:
- FTX secretly **funneled user funds** to Alameda
- Alameda used the funds for **high-risk trades**
- When those trades failed, they kept spending

Imagine this:
> You deposit $10,000 of ETH into FTX.  
> But behind the scenes, it’s sent to Alameda to gamble with.  
> They lose it.  
> Yet your account still says “$10,000.”

That’s not a bug.  
That’s ***fraud***.

---

## 🧊 What Caused the Collapse?

The crash began in **November 2022**.

A leaked report revealed:
- Alameda’s balance sheet was mostly **FTX’s own token (FTT)**
- Meaning they had almost *no real assets*

This triggered panic.  
Investors rushed to withdraw from FTX — like a digital bank run.

FTX didn’t have the money.

- Withdrawals were **frozen**
- FTX **filed for bankruptcy**
- Over **$8 billion** in customer funds vanished

The polished facade cracked.  
Behind it? One of the worst financial collapses in crypto history.

- ⚖️ Charged with **fraud**, **money laundering**, and **conspiracy**
- 💼 His inner circle cooperated with prosecutors
- 👨‍⚖️ Trial concluded in 2023: **GUILTY on all counts**

Once hailed as the “Future of Finance” — now a convicted fraudster behind bars.

## 🔥 Q&A Breakdown: What Really Went Down?

---

### 💥 Q1: What Were Alameda’s “High-Risk Trades”?

Alameda didn’t just trade mainstream crypto. They gambled hard:

#### ⚠️ 1. Leverage Trading
- Borrowed large sums to make oversized bets
- High risk: even small drops in price could trigger liquidations

#### 🎲 2. Speculative, Illiquid Tokens
- Bought obscure tokens early
- Marked them at full value on their books
- In reality: those coins couldn’t be sold without crashing the price

> *Owning 1M MysteryCoins doesn’t make you rich if no one wants them.*

#### 🔂 3. Used Customer Funds as Margin
- Bet using FTX users' deposits
- Promised safety on one screen while gambling behind the curtain

---

### 🫣 Q2: What Did It Mean That Alameda’s Balance Sheet Was “Made of FTT”?

**FTT** = FTX’s own token, created and controlled by them.

- Alameda held billions in FTT  
- Used it as collateral to borrow funds  
- Told investors: “We’re solvent. Look at all this FTT!”

Problem?
- FTT was thinly traded and mostly locked up  
- They couldn’t sell it for real value  
- Their “wealth” was based on a self-made token with no external demand

> *Like claiming wealth in Monopoly money.*

---

### 💣 Q3: Why Did Everyone Suddenly Withdraw?

It all unraveled fast:

1. Alameda’s balance sheet leaked (via CoinDesk)
2. Binance CEO (CZ) tweeted:  
   > “We’re selling all our FTT. Risk management.”
3. Investors panicked  
4. Massive withdrawals from FTX  
5. FTX froze withdrawals — and admitted it was insolvent

A cascade of fear triggered a complete collapse within days.

---

### 🔍 Q4: How Did the Leak Happen?

The leak came from **CoinDesk**. They published:

> Alameda’s liabilities were massive, and its assets were mostly FTT.

Suspected source:
- Internal whistleblower  
- Or an insider with access to private financials

The article shattered public trust and triggered the bank run.
