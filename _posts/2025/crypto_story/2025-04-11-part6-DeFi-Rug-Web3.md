This chapter? Pure chaos. But also... peak crypto.

We’re diving into the days of:
- 🚜 Devs vanishing with millions
- 🌾 APYs so high they looked fake
- 🧻 Joke tokens traded like gold
- 🏰 And the idea that maybe, just maybe, we don’t need Big Tech to run the internet anymore

Let’s go.

## 💰 What Even *Is* DeFi?

**DeFi** stands for **Decentralized Finance**.  
Think all the stuff banks do — but without the banks.

> Lending, borrowing, trading, saving, all powered by **smart contracts**, not paperwork.

And yeah, that means:
- No credit checks  
- No account creation  
- No CEO to freeze your wallet  
- Just code on a blockchain and your crypto wallet

It started as an experiment.  
Then it exploded.

## 🌾 Yield Farming — When Crypto Became a Game

In 2020, DeFi entered its “farming season.”

You could “farm” new tokens by locking up your crypto in protocols. The more you locked, the more rewards you got — sometimes over **1000% APY**.

It worked like this:
1. Provide tokens to a liquidity pool (like ETH + USDC on Uniswap)
2. You receive **LP tokens**
3. You stake those LP tokens into another platform
4. That gives you rewards — like SUSHI, CAKE, or some food-themed coin you’ve never heard of

Then you take those rewards… and stake them again.  
Yeah. It got **that** recursive.

Some people made insane returns.  
Others lost everything in seconds.  
Welcome to DeFi.

## 💀 Rug Pulls & Vapor Projects

For every legit DeFi project, there were a dozen copy-paste scams.

**Rug pull** = when a team launches a token or protocol, hypes it like crazy, then yanks all the funds and disappears.

Some projects didn’t even hide it:
- 🚩 *Anonymous founders*
- 🪞 No audits
- 🐸 Meme-heavy whitepapers (if they had one at all)

Sometimes the token name *already sounded fake*.  
And people still aped in.

> “Don’t invest more than you’re willing to lose,” they said.  
> Then lost it all anyway.

## 🧠 Web3: Decentralization Goes Mainstream (Kind of)

At the same time, a new term started trending: **Web3**.

Web1 = Static websites (just read)  
Web2 = Platforms (read + write)  
**Web3 = You own the data, the account, the content, everything**

No more needing a Google account.  
No more asking Twitter for permission.  
Just a wallet address, and boom — you're in.

The idea?  
> Build a new internet, powered by blockchains and owned by the people.

Did it work?  
Sometimes.  
But hype got ahead of reality. Fast.

Here comes **Part 6 – Final Segment**, baby! Let’s land this arc with DAOs, memes, and the very weird-but-real culture clash that came with it:

---

## 🧑‍⚖️ DAOs — Internet Clubs With Bank Accounts

**DAO = Decentralized Autonomous Organization**  
Basically: an online group that shares a treasury and makes decisions using smart contracts + voting.

DAOs were used for:
- Investment clubs  
- NFT collector guilds  
- Protocol governance  
- Meme projects  
- Even trying to buy the US Constitution (seriously)

Anyone with the token could vote.  
In theory: power to the people.  
In practice: whales still ruled a lot of votes.

But still — it was new, and wild, and exciting.

---

## 🐶 Meme Coins: When the Internet Took Over Finance

Let’s talk about **Dogecoin**.  
It started as a literal joke.  
A meme. A Shiba Inu and some Comic Sans.

Then... Elon tweeted. Reddit pumped.  
It hit $90B+ market cap at one point.

Then came clones:
- Shiba Inu  
- Floki  
- Baby Doge  
- Pepe  
- Wojak  
- And stuff even **more unserious**

Some people genuinely got rich.  
Most didn’t. But it became a symbol:

> If memes could move markets, maybe the internet had more power than Wall Street wanted to admit.

---

## 🧵 The Crypto Vibe in One Line:

> “Is this a revolution… or just vibes?”

That was 2020–2021 crypto.  
Chaotic, hopeful, scammy, and genius — all at once.

---

### ☄️ What’s Next (Part 7...)?

- The NFT boom (and cringe)  
- Tokenized identity  
- Solana vs Ethereum vs Layer 2 wars  
- The merge  
- Real world adoption (maybe)  
- And some serious market crashes

It only gets stranger from here.
