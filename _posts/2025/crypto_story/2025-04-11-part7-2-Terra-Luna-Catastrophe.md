This was the moment when the whole crypto world went:

> “WTF just happened?! Is *everything* fake?!”

Let’s slow-walk into the disaster, step by step. Deep breath.

---

## 🌕 What Was Terra (LUNA) & UST?

**Terra** was a blockchain project.  
**LUNA** was its native coin.  
**UST** was its “stablecoin.”

> And it promised:  
> 🧊 “UST will always be worth **$1** — no matter what.”  
> 🔥 “LUNA will absorb any volatility.”

Sounds magical, right?

It was called an **algorithmic stablecoin** — not backed by real dollars, but by ***smart math and code***.

Here’s how it was supposed to work:

---

### 🧠 The Loop (a simplified version):

1. 1 UST = $1… always (in theory)  
2. If UST drops to $0.98, you can swap 1 UST for $1 worth of LUNA (and make a 2¢ profit)  
3. That swap **burns UST**, reducing its supply, pushing it back toward $1  
4. If UST goes above $1? You mint more UST by burning LUNA  
5. This back-and-forth **balances** the price  

It’s like:  
> *A stablecoin balanced by a dance with another token (LUNA).*

---

## 😱 What Went Wrong?

In May 2022, **UST lost its peg** — it dropped below $1.

At first, people thought:  
> “No big deal. It’ll fix itself like always.”

But it didn’t. It kept dropping.

- 🏃‍♂️ People rushed to redeem UST for LUNA  
- 🔥 That printed MASSIVE amounts of LUNA  
- 📉 LUNA's price crashed because too much supply was flooding the market  
- 📉 The more LUNA crashed, the more UST collapsed too  

It became a ***death spiral***.  
One coin dragging the other down into the abyss. 🕳️🪦

---

## 💀 The Fallout:

- LUNA fell from **$80+ to less than $0.0001** in **days**  
- UST fell from $1 to like… $0.10 (and never recovered)  
- **$45+ BILLION** in value vanished from the ecosystem  
- ***Retail investors lost life savings***  
- Entire **DeFi protocols collapsed** because they held UST or LUNA  
- **Do Kwon**, Terra’s founder, went from crypto god to fugitive (Interpol Red Notice 😬)  

> Some people unironically named the crash **"the Lehman Brothers moment" of crypto.**

---

### 💔 Personal side: Some people took out loans using LUNA as collateral.
- When it crashed, they got **liquidated instantly**
- Some lost everything — homes, savings, peace of mind

It wasn’t just numbers.  
It was **real pain**, from a system that *sounded* like perfect code, but couldn’t survive the real-world storm.

## 🧠 Quick Recap:

| Thing         | Was Supposed To Be         | What Actually Happened        |
|---------------|----------------------------|-------------------------------|
| UST           | A stable $1 coin 🧊         | Dropped below $1 and spiraled |
| LUNA          | Absorber of volatility 🔥   | Got overprinted, collapsed    |
| The Algorithm | Self-stabilizing 🧠         | Created infinite doom spiral  |
| Terra System  | Safe, scalable DeFi 🌍      | Imploded like a black hole 🕳️ |

## 🎯 Why Did People Redeeming UST for LUNA Break the Balance?

### 💡 In theory:
The system promised:  
> “1 UST can *always* be redeemed for $1 worth of LUNA.”

Example: If LUNA = $100, and you redeem 1 UST, you get **0.01 LUNA**.

So if **UST is at $0.98**, smart traders would think:  
> “Let me buy cheap UST at $0.98, redeem it for $1 in LUNA, and make instant profit.”

That mechanism works… if only a *few* people do it at once.

---

### 🚨 But then the **mass redemption** began:

Imagine *everyone* trying to do that at the same time — a massive algorithmic bank run.

1. Each redemption **burns 1 UST** and **mints LUNA**  
2. The system prints **more and more LUNA** to match $1 value  
3. Flooded with LUNA, the market **crashes its price** 💥

👉 More supply = Lower price = Confidence drop.

---

### ⛓️ The Doom Loop (Death Spiral) in Action:

1. LUNA price drops  
2. Each UST redemption now mints **more LUNA per UST**  
   > (because $1 worth = more units as price drops)  
3. That **crashes LUNA further**  
4. The public realizes: UST is clearly **not stable anymore**  
5. Panic selling begins — people **dump UST on exchanges**  
6. Market liquidity dries up  
7. **UST price nosedives**… beyond recovery  

---

## 💥 Why Didn’t UST Go Up When People Redeemed It?

On paper, UST should become **more scarce** when redeemed (burned). That means it should go *up* in price, right?

Yes — in theory.

But in reality:

- 🔻 Panic led to **mass selling of UST**, not redemptions  
- 🏦 Whales and big funds **dumped UST on exchanges**  
- ⚠️ There were no willing buyers left  
- 😱 Confidence was shattered — no one trusted UST anymore  

So even though the burn mechanism was active,  
> The **demand** for UST collapsed *faster than the supply*.  

The result?  
> 💣 UST plummeted to $0.10 and never recovered.  
> The algorithmic stabilizer couldn’t stop a market-wide stampede.

## 🕵️ What Happened to Do Kwon, Terra’s Founder?

This part reads like a hacker-thriller:

- Do Kwon (Kwon Do-hyung), the face of Terra, vanished after the crash  
- 🚔 South Korean authorities issued an arrest warrant  
- Charges included:  
  - Fraud  
  - Securities violations  
  - Selling an unlicensed, unstable financial product  

> Instead of cooperating… he *disappeared.*

So what happened next?

- 🇰🇷 Interpol issued a **Red Notice** (international fugitive alert)  
- ✈️ He was later arrested in **Montenegro**, traveling with **fake passports**  
- 🧳 Caught in an airport like a scene out of *Mr. Robot*

Crypto’s former golden boy became one of its most infamous fugitives.

## 🧠 TL;DR Recap

| 🔍 Question | 💥 Answer |
|------------|-----------|
| Why did redemptions crash the system? | Too many redemptions printed LUNA, causing hyperinflation and a price collapse |
| Why didn’t UST stabilize? | Everyone panic-sold; no one wanted to hold or buy UST anymore |
| What happened to Do Kwon? | Went on the run after the collapse, later arrested with fake documents |
