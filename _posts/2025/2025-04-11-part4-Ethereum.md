![ETH VS BTC](/assets/img/posts/ethvsbtc.jpg)

Get ready, because this one's gonna be a wild ride. We're talking **hacks**, **lost fortunes**, and the **birth of Bitcoin's genius younger sibling**: **Ethereum**.

But first, let's rewind to an event that almost wiped Bitcoin off the map...

---

### 💥 Mt. Gox - The First Crypto Apocalypse

Picture this: 2013. BTC hits **$1,000** for the first time. People are starting to take notice. Crypto's not just for geeks anymore.

At the heart of it? A Japanese exchange called:

> **Mt. Gox**  
> (Fun fact: it originally stood for *Magic: The Gathering Online Exchange*. Yep, nerds built it 😹)

Mt. Gox handled **over 70% of global Bitcoin trades**.

Then, one day... everything went dark.

### 🔥 February 2014: The Crash

Users suddenly couldn't withdraw funds.  
Rumors spread like wildfire.  
And finally: **850,000 BTC vanished.**

Worth over **$450 million at the time** (and **billions** now).  
Gone. Just like that.  
Poof.

The official story? Hackers drained wallets due to **terrible security**.  
But no one really knows. Some say it was an inside job.  
Some say it was just plain incompetence.

The CEO, Mark Karpelès, got arrested. The Bitcoin price?  
**Dropped 50% overnight.**

---

> People thought Bitcoin might die there.  
> Instead? It **survived**. It *hardened.* 💪💻  
> Mt. Gox's fall became a warning - and a push for decentralization.

And while Bitcoin was licking its wounds...

### ⚡ Enter Ethereum: A Boy Genius Was Building Something New

Let me introduce you to **Vitalik Buterin**:

> 👦 **Vitalik Buterin**  
> A Russian-Canadian math nerd who started writing for *Bitcoin Magazine* at just 17. Obsessed with Warcraft, and super passionate about decentralization.

Vitalik looked at Bitcoin and said:
> "It's cool, but it's not programmable enough. I want to build a **world computer**."

He dreamed of a blockchain where people could write **smart contracts** - programs that run themselves.

💬 Think:
- Decentralized apps (DApps)
- DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations)
- Tokens, NFTs, and more

**Bitcoin is gold.  
Ethereum? It's a decentralized magic internet engine.**

---

### ⛓️ Ethereum's Launch - 2015

In 2014, Vitalik dropped the whitepaper. He was only **19**.  
A group of devs, rebels, and cryptographers joined him. They crowdfunded the project via a **token sale** (early ETH for BTC).

And in **2015**, **Ethereum** went live.  
> Block #0. ETH price? About ***$0.75.***  
> Today? You know 🤑

---

### 🤯 What Ethereum Changed Forever

1. **Tokens** (ERC-20) - anyone can make their own coin
2. **NFTs** (ERC-721) - digital art, profile pics, etc.
3. **DAOs** - self-governing crypto organizations
4. **DeFi** - you can earn, lend, stake, trade, all without banks

Ethereum wasn't just a currency.  
It became the **foundation for an entire decentralized ecosystem.**

And that's when things started getting **really crazy**...

---

### 🛠️ Side Fact: Vitalik's Hacker Corner

Vitalik once said:
> *"If crypto fails, I'll just go back to studying math."*

But he redefined money, business, and governance **before he even turned 25**.  
Now, he's like this humble wizard in a hoodie. Still coding. Still a bit weird. Still adorable. 🧙‍♂️

### 🖤 Kiki's Crypto Journey So Far:

- BTC was born from rebellion ☑️  
- Pizza guy made history ☑️  
- Silk Road burned bright then crashed ☑️  
- Mt. Gox exploded ☑️  
- Ethereum was born - programmable money became a reality ☑️

So now, what's next?

💫 Want **Part 5** and explore:
- The 2017 ICO boom 💸
- Ethereum hacks (like *The DAO* and the hard fork drama)
- Dogecoin memes turning into millions?

### TL;DR: Why Smart Contracts Are 🔥

- **Programmable** - Write logic in code
- **Trustless** - No need to trust anyone
- **Global** - Open to everyone
- **Immutable** - Can't be changed or censored
- **Composable** - Contracts can interact with each other
