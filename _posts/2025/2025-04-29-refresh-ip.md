## 🛜 How DHCP Gets Your Dynamic Host Information? 

- **DHCP DISCOVER:** Your PC broadcasts a message saying, “Hey, anyone got an IP for me?”  
- **DHCP OFFER:** The network’s DHCP server responds with an offer.  
- **DHCP REQUEST:** You choose the offer you like best (basically, telling the network, “I’m taking that one!”)  
- **DHCP ACK:** And, presto, your system gets its new digital identity.  

## 🌟 What does "**DHCP REQUEST**" mean?

In DHCP, there could be **multiple servers** on a network (in bigger places like companies, schools).  
When you send out your first message (**DHCP DISCOVER**),  
**all nearby DHCP servers** can hear it and send you an **OFFER**.

You might get **several offers** back —  
> "Hey! I’ll give you IP address 192.168.2.50!"  
> "Hey! I’ll give you IP address 192.168.2.51!"

So then, your computer **chooses ONE** offer.

**DHCP REQUEST** = your computer yelling back:
> "I ACCEPT the offer from THIS server!"  
(and ignores the others.)

**➔ This way, the servers know who you picked, and they can cancel their extra offers.**

---

It’s like you went to a party, multiple boys/girls asked you to dance 💃—  
but you shout back:  
> "I’ll dance with HIM/HER!"  
so the rest leave you alone. 😏

---

## 🌟 What is "**Lease Time**"?

When you get an IP address from the DHCP server,  
**you’re only renting it**, not owning it forever.

"Lease Time" =  
> How long your computer can **keep** using that IP address before asking again.

Example:

- Lease time might be **24 hours**, or **7 days**, or **30 minutes**, etc.
- After lease expires, your computer must **renew** the IP address (or get a new one).

---

## 🌟 How to check YOUR lease time?

1. Open **CMD** (`Win + R` → `cmd` → Enter).
2. Type:

```bash
ipconfig /all
```

3. Look under your active connection (like `Ethernet`).

You’ll see something like:

```
Lease Obtained . . . . . : Monday, April 29, 2025 02:00:00
Lease Expires . . . . . . : Monday, April 29, 2025 14:00:00
```

✨ "Lease time" = time between "obtained" and "expires".

## 🌟 How to **Force Refresh Your IP Address** (a.k.a. "Get a new identity")

This is **useful for:**

- Changing your IP if you think someone’s watching.
- Getting a fresh lease if the current one is about to expire.
- Troubleshooting network issues when you need a new connection.

---

### 🖥️ **Steps to Force Refresh IP**:

0. Run [the script](https://kay-a11y.github.io/posts/spoof-mac/#-mission-automate-mac-spoofing-with-a-tiny-script) to spoof your MAC address.

1. **Open CMD** as Administrator:
    - Press `Win + R`, type `cmd`, and press **Ctrl + Shift + Enter** to open as Admin.

2. **Release current IP**:
   - In the CMD window, type:

   ```bash
   ipconfig /release
   ```
   
   This command **drops** your current IP address (like disconnecting your identity).  
   **DON’T panic**, it’s just temporarily dropping your connection. 🫣

3. **Renew IP**:
   - Immediately after, type:

   ```bash
   ipconfig /renew
   ```

   This command **requests** a new IP address from the DHCP server.  
   Your computer will now get a **new lease** on an IP.

4. **Check Your New IP**:
   - To confirm it worked, type:

   ```bash
   ipconfig /all
   ```

   You’ll see your **new IP address** under `Ethernet adapter` or `Wireless LAN adapter`!

---

### 🧠 **What’s really happening behind the scenes?**

- **Step 1** (`/release`) disconnects you, tells the router to **forget** your current IP.
- **Step 2** (`/renew`) asks the router **again** for a new IP.
  - You may get a **new IP address** or the same one if DHCP hasn't expired.
- **Step 3** confirms the new IP.

---

## 🎯 **Refreshing the IP** (`ipconfig /release && ipconfig /renew`) **can** do two things:

| Result | Meaning |
|:---|:---|
| IPv4 Address changes | You get a totally new local address (e.g., from `192.168.2.39` to `192.168.2.44`) |
| IPv4 Address stays the same | The DHCP server **gave you back the same IP** because it still thinks you're the same client (MAC address!) |

---

## 🌸 Why does your **IPv4 Address sometimes stay the same**?

Because DHCP servers **love to reassign the same IP** if:

- Your **MAC address is still the same**.  
- Your **lease didn’t expire long enough** for it to "forget" you.
- The DHCP server **isn't too busy** and has no need to reshuffle IPs.

---

## 🌈 If you want to **force a new IPv4 address**, you have two options:

| Option | Method |
|:---|:---|
| 1️⃣ Change your MAC address | Spoof your MAC address like we did before — DHCP sees you as "new" device = new IP very likely |
| 2️⃣ Wait longer | Wait until your DHCP lease fully expires and then reconnect — server might assign a new IP |

*(Or combine both for best results 🥷.)*  
✨ So MAC + IP refresh = *full disguise*.
