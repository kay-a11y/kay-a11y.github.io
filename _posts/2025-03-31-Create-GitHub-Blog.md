## üêπ Create a New Repository for Your GitHub Pages Site

1. **Find a Jekyll Theme Template**
    Search in GitHub OR enter `https://jamstackthemes.dev/ssg/jekyll/`, Once you find a theme you like, check the author's profile or documentation to locate the public template repository.

2. **Create a New Repository from the Template**
    For this example, we'll use the [chirpy-starter](https://github.com/cotes2020/chirpy-starter) template. Go to its GitHub page:
        1. Click **"Use this template"**
        2. Click **"Create a new repository"**
        3. **Name your repository** exactly like `<YOU_USERNAME>.github.io` (replace `<YOUR_USERNAME>` with your actual GitHub username). This specific naming convention is required for user/organization GitHub Pages sites.
        4. Ensure the repository is set to **Public**
        5. Click **"Create repository"**

3. **Clone the Repository to Your PC**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/<YOU_USERNAME>/<YOU_USERNAME>.github.io.git
    ```

## üíé Set Up Your Local Development Environment with Ruby & Jekyll

### üõ†Ô∏è Install Ruby and Bundler

Jekyll was written in Ruby, so the first step is to install Ruby.
For Windows users, **RubyInstaller** is the highly recommended method.

1. Download **RubyInstaller with DevKit**
    * Go to the official RubyInstaller downloads page: `https://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/`
    * Find "WITH DEVKIT" section. Download the latest recommended version (it usually has a marker) like `Ruby+Devkit 3.x.x-x (x64)` (e.g., Mine was `rubyinstaller-devkit-3.4.2-1-x64`)
2. Install **RubyInstaller**
    * Run the downloaded `.exe` file.
    * During the installation steps, make sure you check these two boxes:
        *   "**Add Ruby executables to your PATH**" (Crucial for running Ruby commands easily)
        *   "**Run 'ridk install' to set up MSYS2 and development toolchain**" (Installs necessary tools for compiling some Ruby gems)
    ![ruby_installation](/assets/img/posts/ruby_installation.png)
    * After the main installation finishes, a command prompt window will pop up asking about MSYS2 installation:
        ```
        1 - MSYS2 base installation
        2 - MSYS2 system update (optional)
        3 - MSYS2 and MINGW development toolchain

        Which components shall be installed? If unsure press ENTER [1,3]
        ```
        You can usually just press **Enter** to accept the default selection (typically 1,3). Wait for the installation to complete.

        * When you see the following message, the MSYS2 setup is finished:

        ```
        Install MSYS2 and MINGW development toolchain succeeded

        You can use 'ridk enable' to activate the MSYS2 tools on the command prompt.

        1 - MSYS2 base installation
        2 - MSYS2 system update (optional)
        3 - MSYS2 and MINGW development toolchain

        Which components shall be installed? If unsure press ENTER []
        ```
        You don't need to select anything further here. You can close this command prompt window.
3. install **Bundler**
    * **Important:** Close any existing command prompt windows and **open a new one**. This ensures the PATH changes take effect.
    *  Verify the Ruby installation by running:
        ```bash
        ruby -v
        gem -v
        ```
    * Now, install **Bundler**, which manages your project's Ruby dependencies (gems)
        ```bash
        gem install bundler
        ```
    * The output should look something like this:
        ```
        C:\Users\username>ruby -v
        ruby 3.4.2 (2025-02-15 revision d2930f8e7a) +PRISM [x64-mingw-ucrt]

        C:\Users\username>gem -v
        3.6.2

        C:\Users\username>gem install bundler
        Successfully installed bundler-2.6.6
        1 gem installed

        # You might see a message about updating RubyGems like below.
        # It's generally safe to ignore this for now, but you can update later if needed.
        A new release of RubyGems is available: 3.6.2 ‚Üí 3.6.6!
        Run gem update --system 3.6.6 to update your installation.
        ```

### ‚ú® Start Customizing and Previewing Your Blog!

1. **Configure Your Site in _config.yml:**
Open the _config.yml file located in your project's root directory using a text editor. This file contains the main configuration for your Jekyll site. You'll need to customize several settings. Refer to your chosen theme's documentation for all available options, but here are some common ones (using Chirpy as an example - you can see the effect on my [blog](https://kay-a11y.github.io/))
    - `lang: en` (Site language)
    - `timezone: Asia/Shanghai` (Your local timezone)
    - `title: Kay's Void` (Your blog's title)
    - `tagline: Digital Hideout` (A short description)
    - `url: "https://kay-a11y.github.io"` (The final URL where your blog will be live)
    - GitHub username configuration:
        ```yaml
        github:
          username: kay-a11y
        ```
    - theme_mode: dark (make it default then you can have both light and dark mode, but I love dark anyway lol)
    - baseurl: "" (**Important:** For a user/organization site named `<YOUR_USERNAME>.github.io`, this **must** be an empty string `""`.)
    - Excluding files from the build (add custom ones if needed):
        ```yaml
        exclude: 
            - "*.gem"
            - "*.gemspec"
            # ... other defaults ...
            - "package*.json"
            - assets/feed.xml # <--- I added this to prevent the feed.xml conflict I met before
        ```
2. **Install Dependencies and Run the Local Server:**
    * Open a command prompt **in your project's root directory** (the one containing `_config.yml` and `Gemfile`).
    * Run `bundle install`. This command reads the `Gemfile` and installs all the necessary Ruby gems (dependencies) for Jekyll and your theme into the `vendor/bundle` directory (usually).
    * Run `bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload`. This command builds your Jekyll site and starts a local web server. The `--livereload` flag is very helpful as it automatically rebuilds the site and refreshes your browser whenever you save changes to your project files.

### üìë Post Formatting Basics

Creating blog posts in Jekyll follows specific conventions. Your chosen theme might also offer additional helpful *Front Matter* options (aka the metadata at the top of your post).

1. **File name(Crucial)**
    * All post files must reside in the `_posts` directory
    * File name format **must** follow `YYYY-MM-DD-your-post-title.md`, e.g., `2025-03-31-heya-world.md`
2. **File Content: Front Matter + Markdown**
    * Every post file must start with **Front Matter**, which is YAML metadata enclosed between triple-dashed lines (`---`).
    * Following the Front Matter, you write the main content of your post using standard **Markdown**.

Example structure:

```yaml
---
# --- Required Front Matter ---
title: "Your Awesome Post Title"
date: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS +/-TTTT # Use the full date, time, and timezone offset for accuracy
# Example: 2025-03-31 14:30:00 +0800

# --- Optional Front Matter (Theme-specific examples from Chirpy) ---
categories: [Tech, Setup] # Assign categories
tags: [Jekyll, Beginner, Guide] # Assign tags

# Chirpy featureÔºöimage path prefix 
# if you set to /assets/img/posts/my-first-post/
# then you can use ![alt](image.jpg)
# instead of ![alt](/assets/img/posts/my-post/image.jpg)
img_path: /assets/img/posts/

pin: true # If the theme supports pinning posts to the top

toc: true # Enable Table of Contents generation (if supported)

comments: true # Enable comments section (if integrated)
---

# Post Body Begins Here (Standard Markdown)

## This is a Heading

This is a paragraph with some *italic* and **bold** text.

*   A list item
*   Another list item

An example of `inline code`.
```

### üòé DONE! Ready to Preview

The successful respond for command `bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload` would like this:

```
E:\kay-a11y.github.io>bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload
E:/Ruby/Ruby34-x64/lib/ruby/gems/3.4.0/gems/jekyll-4.4.1/lib/jekyll.rb:26: warning: logger was loaded from the standard library, but will no longer be part of the default gems starting from Ruby 3.5.0.
You can add logger to your Gemfile or gemspec to silence this warning.

LiveReload address: http://127.0.0.1:35729
    Server address: http://127.0.0.1:4000/
  Server running... press ctrl-c to stop.
```

Now, open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:4000/` (or whatever Server address is shown). You should see your blog running locally! Any changes you save to your project files (posts, layouts, CSS, etc.) should automatically trigger a rebuild, and your browser page will refresh thanks to LiveReload.

Happy blogging! üëæ
